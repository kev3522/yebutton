Nigga crazy cat about to blow dis, Get rich and stay lowest
Laid in the cut but ya'll bitches still know this
When it comes to chips, you know my niggas stay focused
What I mean, We gotta eat, Ain't nuthin' sweat with that broke shit
Gotta stack it all now, So we can creep
Blowin' smoke out the door now, Boat by the shore now
I'd rather use my mind first, Instead of slugs
Hittin' niggas when the nine burst, Nine bodies and nine hearse
Nine funerals all held in the same church
Thinkin' it's gonna get better but dog it only get worse
Never seen success in my life, son that shit hurt
Possessed by the demons at night, Shit I've been cursed
For all my niggas holdin' it down, Smokin' the pund
Keep ya gun close and keep low to the ground
There is a lotta unfamiliar faces roamin' around
And I won't be satisfied until they low underground

Everymorning I, Start my day off B, All Alone

""So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends?"" 
""My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"" 
Like a cloud in our sky, grab your things let's fly away 
""So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"" 
Malik Yusef, bet your baby momma know the name 
The most critically acclaimed wordsmith in the game 
I give you words spit with flames 
Stay to myself and let nerves mix with lames 
Connoisseur of Kama Sutra, do somethin' absurd with your dame 
I used to love this girl who loved shoppin' and smokin' herb 
But my job was to hustle 'dro 
For you, baby, I'd find you
(You wouldn't get far, far, far)
Fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are
(For you, baby, I'd find you)
Would you like to ride?
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends
My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends?
I had that little ass Nissan at your crib showin' up
Then we rolled to the movies, you rocked your fake Chloes
But that's that last year purse like it's still too cheap
Now you don't want nothin' unless it cost a few Gs
You like the light-skinned Ania, the dark-skinned Aaliyah
The black Jennifer Lopez, a ghetto senorita

Ooh, I love you so 
But why I love you, I'll never know 
Mr Hudson: 
Where you at the whole city behind us
Woooh! They said be all you can be
I just wanna buy another Rollie
I just wanna pop another band
I just wanna sell dope forever
I just wanna be who I am
They said be all you can be
Here we are, in the air, barely breathing
And we're not afraid to die
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?
White Ferrari
Good times
We got so familiar
Had a good time
Bad luck to talk on these rides
Mine on the road
I let you out at Central
I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed
Just me and you girl
Wooooaah ohhh
Trying to sneak upstairs to your apartment
Aren't you a sight for red eyes
I just flew in and slipped in on your left side
Just a satin gown, you asleep with no make-up
I'm just tryna be inside you 'fore you wake up
We had problems but it's all in the past
Everybody got problems baby, algebra class
Remember I used to do things that'd make you laugh
Like orderin' a girl drink in a masculine glass
You like piña coladas, getting caught in the rain
Or rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain
Or that Dolce Gabbana with a few gold chains
And you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name
But, they never let us do our thing
Everybody lying on who I bang
We was on fire but they blew our flame
Ain't no denying baby you have changed
Cause now your high heels clicking, your lip gloss glisten
Your hips start switching, you're pissed off, tripping
Cause even when we're kissing baby girl feel different
Friends all diss him like, ""No he didn't?
No he didn't, is you talking about Kitten?
Is that bitch still stripping?
Trying to get a pair of Christians?""
I swear to God that they got you going crazy
But you play it off and say, ""How is work baby?""
Well some of the models is too coked up to walk straight
Tell me where you wanna
But my credit was so pathetic I couldn't afford a debit
To front on anybody who ever tried to front on me
I could be by myself and enjoy the company
Where you at? The whole city behind us
Southside, outside, Westside, let's ride
Yeah, yeah - I used to front when I write songs
And my beats was so sick, I shoulda got a medic
With so much personality, what do you want from me?
My life, this year, my career, is the Lord
'94 I could only afford this Accord
Eastside, right B-Side, Lakeshore Drive
Ludacris I got silly money - you got jokes?
[Kanye]
Come and let me
Give you what you need
[Kanye West]
Bad chick, this award, is for Melissa Ford
It ain't nothing to it but to do it
But ready to fill your bubble when we put the lead to it
Down South we get buck and turn hearts to Silly Putty
Whatever you want, want, want, want, want, want, want
And wave them around like you just don't care
[Consequence]

Can you say GOOD music?
I said boy don't you know what you do to me?
Right now, nigga!
What the fuck right now?
STINK! (Rah)
(Rah) STINK!
You in my freak dreams
What it is (Uh huh)
What it is (Hey-ey)
What it is
Whatever you want
[T.I]
You won't find it here
I would like to welcome (you)
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well, yeah, yeah
And my head keeps spinning
I gotta get wit' it
Oh ho, oh ho, oh ho
Can't stop having these visions
I can't stop having these visions
I seen it, I seen it before
My friend showed me pictures of his kids
Can't stop having these visions I gotta get with it
Ohhoo ohhoo
Ohhhhoooo
Chased the good life my whole life long
Kid cudi (chorus):
Kanye (verse):
And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs
He said his daughter got a brand new report card
Look back on my life and my life gone
Where did I go wrong?
I've seen it, I've seen it before
Man, we just rollin', rollin'
We major? Come on, homie, we major
Really Doe
You muh'fuckers better do your job and roll up and watch how we roll up and
I can't control it, can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that yak, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazing is how I keep blazing
Towel under the door smoke until the days end
Puff, puff then pass, don't fuck up rotation
Best things are green now pimpin' get your paper
High off the ground instead of skyscraper
Too low thinkin' we local, come on homie, we major
Nas
Hpnotic for Henny, now nigga that's your chaser
Turn nothin to something now pimpin' that's a savior
Feeling better than some head on a sunday afternoon
Better than a chick that say yes to soon
Until you have a daughter, that's what I call karma
Projects to' up, gang signs is thrown up
Niggas hats broke off that's how we grow up
Why else you think shorty's write rhymes just to blow up?
Get they first car and then IRS show up
He ain't never had shit but he had that nine
Nigga come through flickin' and he had that shine
Put two and two together in a little bad weather
Gon' be a whole family on that funeral line
I ain't in the Klan, but I brought my hood with me
Will I ever love again?
Stackin' money 'till it get sky high
(Kids, sing, kids, sing)
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
{​​Skips Message}​​ 
[Answering Machine] 
Message skipped. Next message 
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man
Flickin' Starter coats, man
Sittin' in the hood like community colleges
Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack ya' money till it get sky high
We wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five
""We don't care what people say""
We put shit on layaway, then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid
Oh yeah, I got the perfect song for the kids to sing
And all my people that's
We don't care what people say
If this is your first time hearin' this
You are about to experience something so cold, man
We never had nothin' handed
Took nothin' for granted
Took nothin' from no man
Man I'm my own man
But as a shorty I looked up to the dope man
Man you don't know, man
This is for my niggas outside all winter
Cause this summer they ain't finna'
Say next summer I'm finna'
This dope money here is little Tre's scholarship
You gotta do somethin' man, your ass is grown
That still hustle 'cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55
And everybody selling makeup, Jacob's
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
Damn Kanye is that your car?
(Make it up) we can make it better
(Better we can)
[Kanye West] 
(""Make It Up"") We can make it better 
(Better we can) 
(""Make It Up"") We can make it 
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me
We are the world
We are the children
There comes a time
When the world must come together as one
There are people dying
And it's time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all
We can't go on
Pretending day by day
That someone, somehow will soon make a change
We are all a part of
God's great big family
And the truth, you know love is all we need
Send them your heart
So they'll know that someone cares
Will not be in vain
We can't let them suffer
No we cannot turn away
Right now they need a helping hand
We are the Children
[Michael Jackson]
When you're down and out
There seems no hope at all
But if you just believe
There's no way we can fall
That a change can only come
When we stand together as one
Got to start giving
Homie imma be ight, be ight, be ight
Living this life how I dream it to be
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor (ah)
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
I'm the one your bitch like
Waves don't die
Let me crash here for the moment
I don't need to own it
No lie
Waves don't die, baby
Let me crash here for a moment
That's my bitch
Just to get off and throw my hands up high
I been waitin' for a long, long time
And live my life, and live my life
Let it wash all over me, over me
Everything I do that's not perfect
They wanna be loved, they wanna be loved
That got me walkin' on the moon
And I know it's not just the song
(And I know it's not just the song)
And I know it's not just the drink
(And I know it's not the drink)
But whatever it might be
(Whatever it might be)
Yeah

Holla, holla, hollaaaaa
Baby when I used to love you
There's nuttin that I wouldn't do
I went through the fire for you
Anything you asked me to
But I'm tired of living this lie
It's getting harder to justify
I realize that I just don't love you
Not like I used to
And
Pull out the zip, pull out the ride (roll out)
We so high, upper echelon (Straight up)
We so fuckin' high, upper echelon
Clap your hands everybody

So we got to live out our dreams
Like the people on TV

We want the lord (Yes, Jesus)
And that's it (Yes, God)
Hallej- hand over Satan (Yes, Jesus)
Jesus praise the Lord (Yes, God)
They don't know
(Yes, God)
Hallelujah, God (Yes, God)
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream
This is everything
You know we need it
I'm tryna keep my faith
We don’t want no devils in the house
Yes, darling
We want the lord, he’s sick
My left hand over [?]
Jesus Christ have mercy
Yes darling
Hallelujah
Deliver us serenity
Deliver us peace
Deliver us loving
Pray for Paris
Pray for the parents
We on an ultra light beam
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war
So why send depression not blessings?
You persecute the weak
Because it makes you feel so strong
So I look to the light
(Lord) To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, cause I know that you'll make everything alright
And I know that you'll take good care of your child
Cause I, I look to the light
They don’t know
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Why these niggas wanna hate me mane?
Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybe...
We know we need it
That's why we need you now, oh, I
Everything (Thing, thing, thing)
But I'm looking for more
Why, oh why'd you do me wrong? (More)
(To save) Don't have much strength to fight
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
I will field their questions, I will feel your pain
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Oh you mad, huh?
Ooh I don't need y'all either
Ooh don't wanna talk about it

Kanye West is the name, Southside up in here
Y'all niggas stole the soul, y'all niggas all some clones
Motherfucker close the do', light the weed and let the douja blow
Why you keep bawlin' though girl, you ain't been around niggas before?
My people ain't scared people, only FIG-I-AIR people
Only thing is
I'm not the shooter
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't - because you love what I make
Now ain't - that about a bitch
That Imma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They don't want to turn they speakers up they claim I ain't deep enough
All that talkin' I feed off of - keep it up
I'm relaxin' my feet is up - I'm leavin' you haters
Like when Shaq left the Lakers just to ""Heat"" it up
I state the stats to stunt - I don't need to front
There black history e'ry day - I don't need a month
The survey says - by the streets according
Kanye's just important as Michael Jordan
Was to the NBA when he was scorin'
Ralph Lauren was borin' before I wore him and..
How we got the world to listen
It ain't easy to pretend
I know you lost your cool
And it starting to come back again
You ain't never gotta ask again
Baby this is what we do
Yeah, what you want
Hope he got his towel on
And get my howl on
Some niggas cry wolf, i'm on that dry cush
And when it comes to that paper i stack books
Yeah, You heard what i said
I can put you on your feet or put some money on your head
You're better off dead if you can't pay the fee
(Kanye West)
Boostas, hoes, everybody, fuck that (ohhhhhh)
Still nowhere to go...still nowhere to go... (ohhhhhh)
Still nowhere to go...still nowhere to go
Everybody, fuck that
Low brow, high stakes, crack smoke, black folks
Presidential scandals, everybody move
Calm down, get back, ghetto people, got this
Game ball, lock shit, dump off, cock shit
We won't stop shit, everybody move
These streets know game, can't ball, don't play
Every traffic, one lane, everybody move
Game point lock, long pump cocked
We won't stop, everybody move
Most imitated, Grammy nominated
Hotel accommodated, cheerleader, prom dated
Felt like it rained till the roof caved in
You know how the game be

First thing is I'm an artist and as an artist I will express how I feel with no censorship
2nd thing I asked my wife for her blessings and she was cool with it 
3rd thing I called Taylor and had a hour long convo with her about the line and she thought it was funny and gave her blessings 
4th Bitch is an endearing term in hip hop like the word Nigga 
She was having dinner with one of our friends who's name I will keep out of this and she told him 
(Come on out with your hands up)
Before I turn out ya lights lets get one thing understood
Tell y'all niggas good night, good night, uh
So please refrain from hatin (on me!) before I turn out ya lights
Home boys and some of them we we wish we never knew at all
Home girls said, some of them we wish we never knew at all
Friends, it's a word we use every day
But most of the time we use it in the wrong way
(I'll call you...)
See I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes
And you have no where to go
Imma tell you 'bout the time that I spent with your male
X2
'Fore the day I die, I'm a touch the sky
I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
Gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly

Any pessimists I ain't talk to them
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Back when they thought pink polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop, the doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team, I couldn't work the Lox
Now let's go
Take 'em back to the plan...
Me and my mama hopped in the U-Haul van
Plus, I ain't have no phone in my apartment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I would stand on line
I just wanted to dance
I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance
I just wanted to shine
Jay's favorite line: ""Dog, in due time""
Now he look at me, like ""Damn, dog, you where I am""
A hip hop legend
I think I died in an accident, cause this must be heaven
Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I would do anything to say ""I got it,""
Before anybody wanted K-West beats
Like ""Man, these niggas that much better than me?""
Baby, I'm going on an aeroplane
I couldn't keep it home, I thought I needed a Nia Long
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
Too, too, too late to turn back now
Too late, too late to turn back now
Don't wait til tomorrow
Let me see you put your middle fingers up
To the world, I made up in my mind
Let me say it one more time
Middle fingers up to the world, to the world, to the world
I'm tired of y'all who thugging, I'm tired of y'all who hard
If ever you're listening
If heaven's a prison
Then I am your prisoner
Yes, I am your prisoner
I messed up, ooh
I know now
He knows that his soul in the furnace
Tiimmy, Tiimmy, Tiimmy Turner
He was wishin' for a burner
Fuck bitch on BET
Have her walkin', she fuckin' for BET
Kill everybody walkin'
To kill everybody walkin'
Wildin' for wallet
Born in the nation that breeded us
Why they don't never show me the love?
Jesus Shuttlesworth, I lead the squad
Walk on water while I feed the sharks
Everybody just got made alert (Tiimmy)
You might get killed on your way to work
Everyone seen it in broad day
Nobody feelin' that paperwork
All of the talkin' just made it worse
Throw some D's on that bitch
Just bought a Cadillac
Rich Boy sellin' crack broke niggaz wanna jack
Shit tight, no slack just bought a Cadillac
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
(Intro)
This the remix
I mean, I ain't really into rims and all that
If I'ma take, five, ten stacks of some D's it's gon' be a different kind of D's
You know what I'm saying? Hm?
(Chorus 1)
Kanye's got stacks, ya'll already know that
Just got a stripper chick
Something feel different...
Cute little college chick, linin' up a scholarship
Just got a school grant, spent that on some new tits
Ain't that a true bitch?
Let me show you how to do this shit
(Verse One)
Get you a cute chick, face got potential
Working with her little hips, waist like a pencil
Know how niggas play you, but you know how 'Ye do
Says she love Beyonce, let me upgrade you
Spanish chick grab my chain, says ""is that He-Su's?""
If I'm unfaithful, blame it on the Grey Goose
All my friends says implants is a selfish gift, they all up in
She ain't pregnant but about to have twins
Now, is it real love, I need to ask Cupid
She real smart but her ass stupid
(Throw some D's on that bitch!) 
To the wall
All my rhymes is raw
All these beats beats beats beats beats
(In background)
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
Through the fire, through whatever come my way
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way...
Right down to the wire, even through the fire
For a chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all
Yo G they can't stop me from rapping can they?
Can that huh?
I spit it through the wire man
To much stuff on my heart right now man
I'll gladly risk it all right now
It's a life or death situation man
Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now man
It's your boy Kayne titter....
Chi-Town what's going on man
(Verse 1)
I drink a boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dizzert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man bizerk
Not to worry the Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back wizzork
How do you console my mom or give her light support
When you telling her your son's on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine
She a Delta so she been throwing them dynasty signs
I'm use to trying to reline
I been trying to be sign
Trying to be a millionaire
How I use two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots
But I ain't Jamaican man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here is history in the making man
For chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all
I really apologize how I sound right now man
This ain't fair at all man
Please light ya lighter for the producer and the writer
Doctor, doctor, would you please say somethin'?
I know I almost was the final destination
I musta had a blessin' from Pastor Mason
But, what, I went along with the plan
Paid for my own video, directed by my man
'Bout what we goin' through now
Yo G, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, ha?
It's too much stuff in my heart right now man
I'd gladly risk it all right now
It's your boy Kanye to the
Chi-town what's going on?
I drink a Boost for breakfast, and Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man bizzerk
Not to worry Mr. H said the izzles back to wizzerk
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
On the plane scared as hell, that her guy look like Emitt Till
She was with me before the deal, she been tryin' to be mine
She a delta so she been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use me trying to be lyin', I been trying to be signed
Trying to be a millionaire, how I use two lifelines
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
I swear this right here is history in the makin' man
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut for like
I don't know the doctor said for like six weeks
You know we had reconstruct
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror, half my jaw was missing
In the back of my mouth, man I couldn't believe it
I'm still here for y'all right now man
This is what I gotta say, right here dog
Yeah, turn me up yeah
What if somebody from the Chi that was ill got a deal
Turn it up...(A little louder)
I can't live my I
I can't live my life this way
Continuely get high
Instead of runnin round lock one bird down
It's a new day gotta do it big just to get by (alright)
Show no respect can't live that way
Ya hold my cheque can't live that way
Without my chick on deck can't live that way
They say what they like but I been that way
Our moves calculated through the lense
Almost here
Success will be the best revenge
And now from Clint East to Kanye West
The sun can't chill but everday it sets (every day)
This time I made up my mind
This time I'm deck on the grind
I know there's thing in my life
This me nigga, It's me nigga
While we do our thing, give me six feet nigga
Better take a picture, this is history nigga
I'm busy gettin' money, you can miss me nigga
[Jay-Z]
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us
This ain't a scene; it's a goddamned arms race
I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate
I'm not a shoulder to cry on, but I digress
Do you?
Me too
They say ""What's happenin'?""
We say the facts and if, they lie
We comin' back for them
They might say... but they don't know!
(They say, They say...)
They don't knowwwww
They say a nigga lost his mind
But in the scheme of things I never lost a rhyme
The thin line between love and hatred
I'm the black pill in the Matrix, the saturated life
They say life is what you make it
So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it
As high as the stakes get when paper get low
I be tellin Derick, ""Tell Cara get us a show""
Little Com, I make righteous bitches get low
The richest man ain't necessarily the nigga with dough
They say ""You ripped"" ""Wow..."" Yea, that's what they say
My niggas couldn't tell it was me, like Jamie in Ray
Paintin a day, wit focused crime, broads, and good wine
They say ""Dope is sour so it's homework and hood crimes""
These walls are closin' in 
How long I'm supposed to grin 
I lost my will to win 
Forgive my sin, hmmmmmmmmmm 
(Chorus) 
Can't handle the pressure of you (yeah yeah)
But I got to go
what do I do, what do I say
Gotta get us back to the way
That we used to be back in the day
Who do I call to talk to
Shawty, you ain't gotta be scared of me
All we need is therapy
This is our world, and we will make it
Never over
[CLLLAPS]
Woah
And we will make it
Do-do-do-do
(Cause my baby don't love me)
The way that you do
The money keep comin', it keep on comin'
Pull up on you, hop out stuntin'
This is street ra-dio, for unsung heroes
Riding in they regal, trying to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo
Ye' you know how we do, we do it for the people
You on a run, baby
The storm is on the horizon
I'm standing here alone
Got a pistol on my hip
And it's gonna be some shit
If you want it then bring it on
See I'm a motherfuckin' soldier
And when they asking who I'm is, shit
You just tell them that I'm the one (One, one, one)
Tell them that I'm the one (One, one, one)
Tell them that I'm the one
It's been a week without me
and she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothin' to talk about
'Lest, she talkin' about freakin' out
then maybe we can work it out
Work it out (Come on) [4x]
Work it out now

It's been a week without me and she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but ain't nothin' to talk about
Unless she talk about freakin' out, then maybe we can work it out
Work it out, work it out, work it out, work it out now

On the block it's hot, you can feel it, in your skin and then

We overstated, we underrated, we educated

And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Go tell your friends about it
We are not the same, I am too reckless
These niggas, they been doin' too much flexin'

XO niggas ain't nothin' to mess with
Nobody stoppin' us, oh no, we destined
And everybody 'round you is so basic

Trust me on this one, I'll detach you
Mind from spirit, body from soul

Cotton candy coupe
Hard knock, orphan Annie loop
Off the stoop
My canary shoe
Benji paper made me hater-proof
Menage a trois, purple haze and goose, got me loose
My top down, I'm flashing on em
I'm passing all them, pullover and hit the hazards on em
I'm back performing, I bag em
Break their back, don't call em
Look down on em like Dikembe, Patrick, Mourning
Cash is pourin'
Camera phones capture everything that pictures don't
Ladies and gentlemen
We keep these G's in an alloy safe
They say good things come to those who wait

Now, blaze that!
[Ludacris]
How you ain't gone fuck?, bitch I'm me
I'm young, wild, and strapped like Chi-Ali
Whoop ass, let security carry them out
It feels like a midget is hanging from my necklace
I pulled up with a million trucks
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong
And I'm looking for a thick, young lady to pull
One sure shot way to get them out of them pants
Take note to the brand new dance
Like this
Go on with your big ass, let me see something
Tell your little friend he can quit mean mugging
I'm lit and I don't care what no one thinks
My people outside and they can't get in
The owner already pissed cause we sort of late
Most girls looking right, some looking a mess
That's why they spilling drinks all over your dress
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
Man, man, man
If my manager insults me again I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up then I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check, wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah I stole, never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin' me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
Oh now they love Kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store
Takin' my hits, writin' my hits
Writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind
This fuckin' job can't help him
So I quit, y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love dude
Lock yourself in a room doin' five beats a day for three summers
I deserve to do these numbers
So many records in my basement
I'm just waitin' on my spaceship, blaow
Man, I'm talkin' way past the sky
Let's go, yeah
And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob
At the same time thirsty on the grind
Chi state of mind
Lost my momma, lost my mind
Why you ain't signed?
Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only one to ball
Gotta get mine
I bet they show off their token blackie
The kid that made that deserves that Maybach
+My life, my love+ that's not mine
Never one to fall
Gotta take mine
South (side), South (side)
I know you're thinking, thinking that it must be
Thinking back to the projects, and they way they tore 'em all up
Like when I do a project, and come back and tear the mall up
Southside, Southside
The broads, the cars, the half moon, the stars
I'm like Jeff Fort the way I get behind bars
Back in '94 they call me Chi-town's Nas
Now them niggas know I'm one of Chi-town's gods
We coming from the Southside, Southside
Southside, side of the Chi
Your fly is open, McFly
I'm back from the future seen it with my own eyes
And yep, I'm still the future of the Chi
Back in college I had to get my back up off the futon
I knew that I couldn't cop a coup with no coupons
I smoke purp to the haze
Smoke haze to the cheese
Smoke cheese to the kush
Smoke kush to the sourdeezal
And I ain't feeling... anything
It's so soulful Man
Called love
(Some people hating)
Some people hating
John Legend on the backgrounds by the way
If I talk to people like they stupid as hell
It's so soulful man, it's so soulful man
I spit them lines that make a rapper have a brain attack
I can hardly see in front of me
At last I am free
One hand in the air if you don't really care
For your boy
(are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)
Smokey Robinson

Broke, broke, broke phi broke (we ain't got it)
[Quietly]
[Louder]
Broke, broke broke phi broke (we ain't got it)
Broke, broke, broke phi-
[Leader:] I've called this private meeting today because there is an imposter among us
There is an imposter among us
This brother right here has been out making beats on the side, yes he has
Pretending he's broke walking amongst us
This brother has been eating every day, can you believe that? Eating every day
Pretending he's with us, he's not one of us
I did not want to believe this, but I walked into the brother Kanye's closet and I found new shoes
I found new shoes!
Kanye, would you like to step forward and explain these new shoes?!
(We ain't got it)
We broke, broke broke phi broke
Broke, broke, broke phi broke
Don't spend no money
Ain't got no clothes
Ain't got no cars
Ain't got no hoes
We broke, broke, broke phi broke
I brought you brothers here to start our own fraternity
Broke Phi Broke, we ain't got it
Broke Phi Broke (we ain't got it)
No, we have no money
We are sharin' jeans
If I go outside, I got the only clothing on
How many cars do we own? (None!)
All on that day
I run to the sea, it was bleeding
I run to the sea, it was boiling
(Power to the Lord)
Power
Bring down
Since you came in my life
I'm in the club posted up, got my arms folded
I'm just twistin' my body from side 2 side
Twistin' my body from side 2 side
Blunt in my mouth and these haters I'm scopin'
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
[Pre-Hook]
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
M.O.B, she call me selfish
Success got 'em jealous
Tattoos, how they break the news
It was real if you made the news
Last night my bitches came in twos
Dropped out the first day of school
'Cause niggas got cocaine to move
This the greatest shit in the club
Rockstar bitch call me Elvis
Shorty's killing, while I'm drilling
And they both suck like they came to lose
I be going hard, I got a name to prove
Killing 'em, honey how I make the pain improve
I'm calling
Out to
All my
Y'all my ladies, and I can't
Let you, be with, no one, but me, baby
(Chorus)
Out to (I want you to myself I can't help it)
All my (yeah maybe I'm selfish)
(I can't) Let you (let you)
(I want you to myself I can't help it)
And steal the spotlight like Mr. Bentley
I spotted her like Spud McKenzie
From the Polo fleece to the Jesus piece
To my thick chicks down in Texas
And in LA every chick's an actress
Hollywood status with the shaded glasses
And Hot Atlanta y'all is one of the best
And New York women are way too fresh
Too much on your mind let me ease that stress
I wish you all were mine it's so selfish
In small towns that I don't even know
To all local international codes
All my (Yeah maybe I'm selfish)
Y'all my ladies
And I can't (Maybe I'm selfish)
Let you (I want you to myself, I can't help it)
Be with no one
But me, baby
And for them fake boobies I payed them Benjies
And everything you do is extra cold
I got family in high places like Jesus' niece
a way that all, all falls down
i tell you oh, it all falls down
Kanye West:
A way that all, all falls down
I tell you oh, it all falls down
Chorus (Syleena Johnson):
Man i promise shes so self conscious she has no idea what shes doing in college that major that she majored in dont make no money but she won't drop out her parents will look at her funny. Now tell me that ain't insecurrr. The concept of school seems so securrr. Sophmore three yurrs ain't picked a carurr. She like fuck it ill just stay down hurr and do hair cause thats enough money to buy her a few pairs of airs cause her baby daddy dont really care. Shes so precious with the peer pressure,couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter alexus. She had hair so long that it looked like weave then she cut it all off now she look like eve. And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe single black female addicted to retail.and well
a way that all, all falls down 
i tell you oh, it all falls down 
Tell everybody that you know
I got the right to put up a fight
But my sight is better tonight
And I might see you in my nightmare
Cause we were once a fairy tale
But this is farewell
I got my life and it's my only one
I got the night, I'm running from the sun
So good night, I'm headed out the door..
After tonight, I'm taking off on the road
I'm taking off on the road
And that you know
That I don't love you no more
The stars is out, I'm ready to go
I prøver at følge med men vi er så svære at gennemskue
[Michael]
[Janet]
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
With such confusion don't it make you want to scream? (Make you want to scream?)
Gangstas walk, pimps gon' talk
Oooh hecky naw that boy is raw
Yeah...
Three in the morning the pancake house
Four in the morning we be rolling to my house
Five in the morning the lights go out
Six in the morning you can hear us start to shout
Seven in the morning she'll be callin'cab
Eight in the morning talking about the mush she had
Nine in the morning man she just gettin' home
Talkin' about the over night scenario, scenario
Bitch, you better have died
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will, unless you will
Don't say you will, you will, you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, then play you will, I pray you will
Don't say you will, you do
Don't say you will, one day you will, I pray you will
When I grab your neck, I touch your soul
Why would she make calls out the blue
Mrs. So Fly crash-lands in my room
Can't waste no time, she might leave soon
Don't say you will, unless you will, I pray you will
Don't say you will
How about we go and save the night
Yeah, yeah
Radio, fuck you!
We alive tonight, bro!
[?] is alive tonight, bro
These these niggas keeping this shit alive, bro
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Yeah, 9:08 L.A. time
Back in the lab and shit
My wife said, I can't say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon' both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no
People tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter
My friends' best advice was to stay low
I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin'
The media said he's way out of control
I just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'
I'm not out of control, I'm just not in they control
I know I'm the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generation's closest thing to Einstein
So don't worry about me, I'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God For Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with with no permission, on our own conditions
Most Blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasn't supposed to make it past 25
And you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
The night sky, yeah, I feel like I'm home, yeah
I've been wakin' the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro
If the phone ringin', go and get your kids ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook
But buy a new car, talkin' 'bout ""how my neck look?""
Four hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains
The light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary?
I am one with the people
I am one with the people (real)
I've been woken from enlightened man's dream
Facebook, lying to you
Radio, lying to you
I know there's a lotta real niggas working at radio
Real people, real program directors
With wives and kids that love music that can't play what they wanna play
Because they've been paid to play that bullshit
Over and over and over
And when I said ""that bullshit""
I don't mean - what I'm saying, is
We love Drake, Drake is great!
He a great artist!
But Frank Ocean is great too!
But you know who's the greatest of all of us?
Who do y'all think?
Nope! Kid Motherfucking Cudi!
Oh yeah, I'm on my Trump shit tonight
Yeah, I'm taking - taking his lead!
Imma just say how I say
Imma just say - I'm just be Ye, and win!
Imma take his lead!
What'd you say, did you say it?
Ayy ayy, what'd you say, bro?
Ayy ayy, is it ""radio, fuck you""?
Is that what you said? Exactly
Not - not the, not ""fuck the people that work at radio""
Cause these is real people that gotta feed they kids
And they not being allowed to play that real shit
Cause they think, in order to feed they kids
They gotta play the same shit over and over and over
I was raised by KRS-One
I was raised by A Tribe Called Quest
I was raised by DMX
The last real nigga alive?
Nah, nigga, it's still real niggas alive!
We alive tonight, bruh!
Rocky alive tonight, bro
Ayy, y'all at my show
When I say these names, y'all better scream for me
I don't give a fuck if you know these names or not
Go head, Google 'em!
They will give you a little bit of factual information
They will give you that
Why did I name ASAP? Cause that's the future!
That's the niggas that got me and Cudi on our toes like that
It's life, we got a hundred years down here
A hundred years on this planet, bro
And we can have a utopia
We can love each other
But the rules gotta be fair
Khaled, and Drake, and radio, and Doc, and 92.3
And everybody - is it just me
Or did you hear that song so many times
Ayy, ayy, you know what it is, though?
Cause ayy, I love Drake! I love Khaled!
They set that song up, bro!
And let me tell you something!
MTV, fuck you! Once again, as always!
I'm on my Trump shit tonight!
Ayy, you know me
I went down 7 years of my life of motherfuckas hating me
Cause I said Beyoncé had the best video
The prodigal son, Kid Cudi, has returned!
The vibes is back
I know there's gonna be a lot of conversations after tonight
Please do not send 'em at my head
I just wanna have a conversation about how we playing radio's gaming
Khaled, you a real nigga
Khaled, you a real nigga, you got the keys
But as we learned, all them politics that niggas was doing for years
Obama couldn't make America great, cause he couldn't be him
To be who he was
Black men have been slaves
Obama wasn't allowed to do this:
[Kanye screams and flails his arms erratically]
And still win, he had to be perfect!
But being perfect don't always change shit, bro
Being perfect don't always change shit, bro
So when I talk about MTV, let me explain something
I was hurt, Beyoncé, I was hurt
Because I wanted to present a video called ""Fade""
And outta respect MTV told me
""Mr. West, out of respect to you, I will let you know
That Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for ""Formation""
Over ""Hotline Bling"", and ""Famous""
They told me beforehand so I wouldn't run on stage
Ayy bro, y'all ain't gotta fuck with me
But you know I got the vision
And you know Imma keep it real witchu
Beyoncé, I was hurt
I went down 7 years on behalf of yo -
Sex, sex tell me wh-
Sex, what you know about sex?
Oh my god, you're so hot
Pull my hair, let me get on top
Oh my god, soaking wet
Back and forth till we break the bed
(Hook)
Runaway from you baby,
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can
Run away from me, baby
Run away
Look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya (Ladies and gentlemen)
She find pictures in my email
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
So I think it's time, for us, to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags, let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags, every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs, that'll never take work off
Baby I got a plan, run away fast as you can
Run away from me baby, run away
Run away from me baby, run away (Look at ya)
Look at ya, look at ya

So I think it's time, for us, to have a toast 
Let's have a toast for the douchebags, let's have a toast for the assholes 
Let's have a toast for the scumbags, every one of them that I know 
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs, that'll never take work off 
Baby I got a plan, run away fast as you can 
Run away from me baby, run away 
Run away from me baby, run away (Look at ya) 
Is who's gonna run this town tonight
Only thing that's on my mind
We are, yeah, I said it: we are
Round and round they go
1500, all in singles (Straight up)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
Lifestyle on camera
Hundred thousand dollar chandelier
They tried to turn me to an animal
But white people think I'm radical
Supermodels think I'm handsome
You might think I'm too aggressive
Really I think I'm too passive
'Til I pull out the chopper, start blastin'
I'm sick and tired of you sittin' around here all day
I'm sick and tired of you smokin' weed in the hallway
But why you worried about me?
Why you worried about what I'm doin' here?
Why you got to embarrass me in front of company?
The Roc Boys in the building tonight
We the dope boys of the year, drinks is on the house
(We in the house, house)
You will never stop it now
I told her it's some things she don't need to know
She never let it go
You never stop it now
Drop it, drop it
'Bout the baddest girl I ever seen
Straight up out a movie scene
Who knew she was a drama queen
That'd turn my life to Stephen King's
Checking everything like I'm on parole
You need to drop it now
Cause I don't want no Robocop
When did you become a Robocop
Just looking at your history
You're like the girl from Misery
She said she ain't take it to this degree
Well let's agree to disagree
Shorty kind of crazy but it turn me on
Keep it up enough to keep it going on
I told her there's some things she don't need to know
She never let it go, oh
[Couplet 1: Kanye West]
[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
All my niggas look rich as FUF
Hit rewind if your ass didn't hear me clear
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't come for me today
I'm feeling good
But no baby, no baby, not today
(Reaper) Oh reaper
(Reaper) Oh no baby, no baby, not today
How many of us
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Didn't you know
I was waiting on you
Staring at the mirror looking down into its eyes
I can see why niggas hate ya, I can see why they despise
Don't worry, don't worry
No worries, no worries
Cause I'm as real as they come
Staring at the mirror looking down into its eyes 
I can see why niggas hate ya, I can see why they despise 
Don't worry, don't worry 
No worries, no worries 
High as a motherfucker
Fly as a motherfucker
[Bridge: Kanye West]
They ain't wanna turn their speakers up
I put on for my city, on on for my city
I put on, I put on, I put on
Send them pussy niggas runnin' straight back to the dealership
Know you niggas hungry, come and get a super plate
Hundred karat bracelet, I use it like some super bait
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
Put on (Eastside), put on (Southside)
Put on (Westside), put on, let's go!
Passenger's a redbone, her weave look like some curly fries
Pocket full of celery, imagine what she tellin' me
Blowin' on asparagus, the realest shit I ever smoked
Ridin' to that Trap or Die, the realest shit I ever wrote
They know I got that broccoli, so I keep that Glock on me
(Man, I'm the pusha man)
You don't know, then you's a lame
Man, I'm the pusha man
Na-na-na-nah
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
Already know I'm too fly
'ey baby, am I crazy?
Or was you givin me the eye?
You said maybe? (Yea) Well, you crazy
Because I know I'm too fly
Already know I'm too fly (You hype!)
Right now I'm off the wine, wine, we can take our time, time
So much I want to punch spill the bump when we grind
My uh is in ya body, my uh is in ya mind
Check my dictionary, that ass is so divine
It slippery when it's wet girl, I can read the signs
I knock and I knock, uhh, can I come inside?
I knock and I knock, girl, can I come inside?
I feel like it's home when I'm in between ya thighs
It's the joy and the pain and the bites and the brain
What make it feel so good, that type of stuff you can't explain

You got the invite tonight and I'm so glad ya came
Mic check like the way I begin my show

Turn around, it's about to be a TKO
Black X6, Phantom 
Thank you for this prom night

Look at, look at your business tux, all night airplane
Go and get your racist on, all white everything

I ain't even write this down I don't write errthing
I know y'all don't like everything
She want a night she can call her wedding
Giving Eskimo kisses, with some Eskimo bitches
Nose diving, going all night sledding
Got her toes done up, with her finger nails matchin
Got her toes done up with her finger nails matchin
[Repeat]
Got Got her toes done up with her finger nails matchin
Toes, toes done up with her finger nails matchin
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matching
Make it knock knock when you're partyin
Take a break break in the audience
Do your footwork break and stop again
Steady flickin I'm holdin down that lawaway rack
Aye, rhinestones all in they face
Gold charms and paper chase
Talk smack from around the way
Gotta put these chicken heads in they place
I ain't rockin no stupid bapes
When I hit the block all the people say
Got, got her toes done up with her fingernails matching
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matching
I'm on it it's an anthem
Who is that in the phantom?
Please no cameras
They gone have me on ConcreteLoop in my pajamas
To hide the goods I would need pants big as Hammer's
I be tippin them dancers
They be sayin I'm handsome
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got, got her toes do up with her fingernails matchin'
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
My name is Keri, I'm so very
Fly oh my it's a little bit scary
You can stare but if you touch it I'mma bury
Pretty as a picture
And then they
Clap, clap, clap
No one man should have all that power
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power
And then they say
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
This is way too much, I need a moment
And then they (Go)
(21st century schizoid man)
Fuck SNL and the whole cast
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
Is this thing on?
Oh, I thought they silenced us, Ye
Power to the people
The penthouse is the projects and everybody flies private
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
(No one man should have all that power)
Rumble, young man, rumble
You gotta go through pain in order to become you
But once the world numbs you, you'll feel like it's only one you
Now you got the power to do anything you want to
Until you ask yourself, ""Is this what it's all come to?""
But do you have the power to get out from up under you
To be continued, we on that Norman Mailer shit
Tell her this
The system broken, the school is closed, the prison's open
We ain't got nothing to lose, motherfucker we rolling
Huh? Motherfucker we rolling
So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning
Huh? I'll see you in the morning
Till then, fuck that, the world's ours
And they say
(21st-Century schizoid man)
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically they can kiss my asshole
You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Now when I walk in, everybody do the ""Power"" clap
Fresh for the club, I just took a half an hour nap
My socket was out the plug, now it's time to get the power back
Clap, clap
I seen people abuse power, use power, misuse and then lose power
Power to the people at last, it's a new hour
I don't stop until I see the end, my vision clear, bitch
I'm on my Van Gogh, I don't hear shit
The brown hero, live from Ground Zero
Machine gun flow, made of ghetto Ross Perot
The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons open
So goodnight, cruel world, I see you in the mornin'
Huh? I see you in the mornin'
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours
And then they say (hey) and then they say
Tell 'em Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault
Reality is catchin' up with me
And we gon' stay hustlin on that block until we caught
And we gon' stay showin off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin out the stores with heavy bags
Cause we be poppin tags, pimpin we be poppin tags!
Strange Fruit

Oh Ah Oh Oh Oh Ah Oh Oh (When I)
Pa-Pa-Pa Poker Her Face Pa-Pa Poker Her Face (I Make Her Say)
Threw The Day
My dog tryin' to knick-knack, give a dog a paddywhack
Paddyback that, yeah, bounce it on my lap, lap
She's a real dick-pleaser
To turn this muh'fucker up only if it feels right
I'll be late for that, baby, I'll wait for that
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, piss on your grave
Yo, yo, yo
I use your face as a urinal
Then do the same at your funeral
This one here for the executives
Fuck you and all your relatives
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, nigga behave
Nigga behave, nigga behave
Us niggas, we can't behave
We mobbed on the pave
Got treated like slaves
Young niggas treated like slaves
This the moment I've been waiting for
This why I moved to Cali, stepped outside and got shaded for
Told momma, ""bitch get back in the door""
I've been coming up and down, a nigga can't take no more
Kamikaze over commas
Benjamins, dividends stuffed in my jeans
I can't fit in
Poppin' pills since droppin' Ritalins
Pop a penicillin, nigga you gotta get with it
Wise men say
For all the fame of flashing lights?
For all the fame, and flashing lights
There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no clothes that I could buy
There is no vacation spot I could fly
Pinocchio's story goes, to be a real boy
I just wanna be a real boy
That could bring back, a piece of real life
Real life,Real life
The baddest nigga out there bro
Never figure out real love
You'll never figure out real love
It's so crazy
I get everything figured out
But for some reason I can never find what real love is about
No doubt, everything in the world figured out
But I can never seem to find what love is about
Do you think I sacrificed real life
Do you think I sacrifice a real life
There is no YSL that they could sell
To get my heart out of this hell
And my mind out of this jail
That could turn back the time
That could bring back a piece of real life
Real life, what does it feel like?
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like? I ask you tonight
To live a real life?
I just want to be a real boy
They always say Kanye, he keeps it real boy
Pinocchio story is, I just want to be a real boy
Pinocchio story goes to be a real boy
It's funny, Pinocchio lied
And that's what kept him from it
Wise man say, wise man say
Wise man say
There is no Y.S.L. that they could sell
To get my heart, out of this hell
And my mind, out of this jail
That could turn, back in time
To live a real life
Lying there in the mire is a mama and child
Their anguished cries trampled by boots on either side
Cause we like to party, hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Cause we like to party!
You worry bout the wrong things
The wrong things
Oh here we go

Baby don't worry about it
Lady we'll go out to the floor
They'll never know you
Anyway they don't know you like I do
[Produced by Kanye West and No I.D.]
I don't never feel pain, cause I done felt too much pain
[Sample]
Drive whips, I know they like
Twista, you told her right
(I could make you a celebrity overnight)
Give you ice, like Kobe right
We sorta like Goldie right
The way, we mode em right
There's only one girl on my agenda
(You talking bout Brenda?)
Naw I'm talking bout Linda, from last September
Now Linda love lace like Linda love lace
LaFace says she like +Mase+ but she love +Face+
And I know that Linda was a hip-hop-head
And I know that Linda gave Hip-Hop head
But I feel I could convert her
Cuz I ain't here to hurt her mayn
And she was messin wit me when I was still at Burger King
She ain't hop in my bed cuz of the whips and cream
Cuz when I had her in bed I had whip cream
Shakespearian midsummer night dream
I unzip things and pull out big things
They was flashin gr-green, she was like ""ch-ching""
Got em, but she know a rreeal nigga when she, spot him
So now she's pickin dresses from Veroraiyn
Scratchin out her maiden and here's my name
Now I'm sittin at the bar wit all my guys
They sayin ""Cheers to you for your future years of pain""
Like ""Dog you ready to give all this shit up?
The summer's on its way and these hoes doin sit-ups
And when they see the way the G-5 lights lit up
Your gonna wanna have two like John Ritter""
But naww, I bought her a brand new BM
I hear her speak to me
Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'
So tell the voice inside ya head to believe it
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel
And look at all that he gave you
You asked for one and you got two
You know I never left you
So I can say
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
Hello my only one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes
Remember how I'd say
And if you knew how proud I was
You'd never shed a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that
Umuyorum ki kendi kendine yapmayı öğrenirsin
Ve eğer kendini seversen, bil ki asla yalnız olmayacaksın
Umuyorum ki istediğin ve seçtiğin her şeyi alırsın
Man, that doesn't make it right
And the darkest hour is just before dawn
Each night before you go to bed my baby
And I can't stop now
On sight
Let me show you right now before you give it up
Left, right, right, left
We go left, right, right, left
C'mon left, right, right, left
Now if my man Benzino got a Benz and they call him Benzino
Right now my car and home would be repo'd
But I don't want nobody to fuck my bitch
Oh, oh
Let me call some, call some girls that I know, know
I don't mean the bougie ones from before, 'fore
I need some girls that's really down to get low, low (to the wall)
But this is the last time
You're my number one
Ooh I promise not to do it again
I promise not to do it
You can't say I don't love you
Just because I cheat on you
'Cause you can't see all I do
To keep you from knowing the things I do
Like erase my phone
And keep it out of town
I keep it strapped up when I sleep around
Well I should have known one say you'd find out
But you can't go and leave me now
You know that I love you
There's no one above you
I said it the last time
Don't make me over
'Cause I can be faithful
Baby you're my number one
Now who is she?
What's her name?
You don't need to know about everything
We fight about this
We fight about that
You hang up the phone and call me right back
Well I'll never be something I'm not
Please don't throw away what we've got
'Cause we've been together for way too long
I was playing around but I'm coming home
You know that I love you (know that I love you)
There's no one above you (no one above you)
I said it the last time (hey, hey)
Don't make me over (don't leave me baby)
'Cause I can be faithful (you know I try)
Baby you're my number one (baby)
I keep you laced up so you ain't gotta borrow nothing
From them broke ass friends who be bargain hunting
Stopping you
Not enough time in one lifetime
To love you like you deserve
With nobody to love
I know you're tired
Of lovin', of lovin'
Nobody, nobody
So just grab somebody
No leavin' this party
Nobody, nobody to love
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail

Dangerous, dangerous
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it
I wanna have more, I wanna drive more nice cars
I wanna, wanna have gas
Yeah 
I just wanted you to know
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
Psycho: I'm liable to go Michael, take your pick
Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
Audemars that's losing time, hidden behind all these big rocks
Ball so hard mothafuckas want to fine me
(That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray)
Let's go
You see there's leaders and there's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves
My momma was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that ""Don't touch anything in the store""
All you blacks want all the same things""
New Slaves
I throw these Maybach keys
I wear my heart on the sleeve
Want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation
Doing clothes you would have thought I had help
And this rich nigga racism
That's that ""Come in, please buy more
What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
Used to only be niggas now everybody playing
Spending everything on Alexander Wang
They throwing hate at me
Y'all niggas can't control me
Breeze driftin' on by, you know how I feel 
Who will make the sacrifice?
And lay your love on the line
Still learning how to fly
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
[Bridge] 
Clap your, clap your hands, hands 
Can you clap your hands, hands 
Yo what you doing here huh?
(Hi I thought I'd drop by so nice to see you)
Nice to see you too okay
(It's been too long)
Yeah you can leave now
Kanye that nigga with heavy dough
Roll dro and a chevy low
Whether in Jamaica or Cancun, Mexico
We got physical now she calling and beeping
Talking bout girls I could get her whatever she want (Whatever I want)
I'm like girls like you be wanted for warrants
Hmm, Tanisha its over with stop playin
I'm never letting go
Never letting go
Get up, I get down
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you never let me down
Down
[Instrumental]
Get up i get(down)
I get down for my grandfather who took my momma
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in
You know what I'm saying
N.I.G.G.A, That's whats I say when I'm with all my niggas and chillin around way
Aye
500 years of living life as a slave
But nigga Look how far we done came we unchained

Can you go where I go?

All the bottle poppin
Patron we rockin
Err everybody drunk
We could be friends

I'm not lovin you, way I wanted to
So everybody else don't have to know
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So ya never know, never, never know
Never know enough, til it's over, love

Keeping ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Now keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Now keep ya love locked down, you lose
I'm not lovin you, the way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got somethin' to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you fo' it finally got through
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I'm not lovin you, way I wanted to 
I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
I'm down on my line
I'm lost in the world
I'm new in the city
If we die in each others arms
I’m up in the woods, I’m down on my mind
Down for the night
You're my now, you're my forever
You're my war, you're my truce
Said I'm ‘bout to go Gucci Mane
Remind me again why we in this shit?
Remind me again, remind me again why we in this shit?
Real niggas don't live too long in this shit

Yo, this sound like some movie shit right?

Keri Hilson
Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
Knocks you down
Ohh, this ain't supposed to happen to me
I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you my mind goes on a trip
I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down
But I know it feels so damn good
Don't you know I would baby if I could
She shot the bullet that ended that life
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight

All you others wanna find me?
Verse 1
I'm on that second base
That second base
So you're beneath my place
You better look a lil closer
Cuz I am not a poser
I flick em off my shoulder
(Where?)
(Oh)
We got way too much in common
Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too
Goodnight usually means goodbye
Look at you, look at you
Look what you made me do
How do you, how do you think know my every move
Who are you? Who are you? You look so familiar
I know you, I know you, baby, I know the truth
If I’m being honest with you
Since I’m being honest with you
I started small time, dope game, pushin on the corner
Twenty cent cook-up, fifty flippers if you want 'em
Full of formaldehyde, my clothes wreakin marijuana
Cops rollin up on us, my neighborhood's like a sauna
Pistol-grippin, insurin won't nobody run up on us
But if they do, fuck 'em, we murderous nickel-dome 'em
I ain't playin no games, I'm on a mission fo' the change

KW: No.
From my theme song
My leather black jeans on
My by any means on
Pardon me gettin' my scream on
Enter the kingdom
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
And at the top door they gon come at you King Kong
Middle America packed in
Came to see me in my black skin
My homey was number one draft pick
They slip on his jersey and act rich
If I don't get ran out by Catholics
Here come some conservative Baptists
Sayin he overreactin'
Like them black kids in Chiraq bitch
4in the morning, and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where's the trojans?
And I've been a menace for the longest
So follow me up cause this shit's about to go down
I'm doin' 500, I'm outta control now
But there's nowhere to go, now
And there's no way to slow down
Runnin' out of time - moving fast
So just close your eyes and then enjoy this crash
The All-Seeing Eye is watching tonight
It's like, everybody in this party shining like Illuminati
(What's a nigga to do?) Hann
(If I shoot you) I'm brainless
(If you shoot me) then you're famous
(What's a nigga to do?)
Ayo, he pulled out his gun and started schemin'
Stood right there, blue trees in his space like police bleamin'
80, nothin' like these new born babies
Fresh off the recliner, guns squeeze, pay me
Hit an L, dynamic, move like I'm Wit and Dale
All of this is made like waves, I make sicker sail
There's niggas that rhyme and niggas that grind
That's my man, we only in the Benz that don't shine
Comparing me to money, suitted up Fila jumper
With the New Balance on I'm fine
The specialist, curly haired kids perpetuous
Slide in your bitch, give her dick that's treacherous
Catch me on leany, egged out, GreyGoosein' in the coupe
Callin' up Duke, come see me
Wise words givin', saw him in a flyin' spur
Givin' sign in the earth, lets work, nigga
I used to wonder how people became stars and then return to their roots
Till I had to switch up the Cons, take a turn of the roots
Cause the fact they had Kwon out their CD changer
It must've been enough to turn my friends into strangers
Cause now they keepin' secrets when I'm in danger
And mirrors wise crack like god in the manger
But why should I name ya? I can speak to your conscience
You would feel the position that you see your boy Cons in
Cause now I'm on fire like the start of an arson
And even TV gettin' dinner like (?)
So the way I disappear right before Autumn hits
Or be like a magician like picked from the audience
Ooh, you you you
Some people just don't know what they have
But boy I'm so glad I got you
Some people say they search all their life
But boy it's so nice I found you
Some people want it all
I don't want nothing at all
[Noreaga]
Right now
I'm worth it
He said
DJ Class in this bitch! Mr. West in this bitch!
We done told you mu'fuckers now you know who the shit!
Up in this bitch (Up in this bitch)
Yeah I'm the shit (I'm the shit)
Cause I'm the shit (Yeah I'm the shit)
Yeah I'm the shit (Yeah I'm the shit)
Yeah Yeah
I'm the shit
Up in this bitch
Yeah I'm the shit
I really like her
Cause I'm the shit
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
One hand in the air, if he don't really care
Life can be sometimes ridiculous
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean goddamn
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
That was a little joke, voila
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas
I mean the shit is fuckin' ridiculous, fuckin' ridiculous
I mean the shit is fuckin' ridiculous
When we roll round 'pon your block
- you know what I mean 
I'll fly away.
Wondered if you'd ever, ever find your dreams?
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
What it means to find your dreams
Find your dreams come true
I've been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at night
You say I think I'm never wrong
You know what, maybe you're right, aight
You say he get on your fuckin' nerves
You hope that he get what he deserves, word
Do you even remember what the issue is
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It ain't happen yet
And that's what the intuition is
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
I just want to take you out and show you off
You already know that you the perfect one
Girl when I'm with you, feel like a champion
Ever since I got with you I feel like I done won me a trophy
A trophy, I won me a trophy
Trophy, I won me a trophy
I wish you would nigga
I guess it's how I came up
I wish you would try to play us
(I've got good music on my radio)
(Yeah)
Birds singin', tryin' to make things right
I wish you were here with me
Only makes it that, that, that much more perfect
Only makes it that, that, that, that much more worth it
Only, only only, only every time when I short-circuit
Only makes it that much, much, much more perfect
Much more perfect, I need it all
I want it all, I need it all, go through it all, climb every wall
Take every fall, break every law, I need it all, I need it all
Go through every wall, take every fall, break every law
Yeah, I want it all, I want it all, I want it all
I want to love you
(P.Y.T.!) Pretty Young Thing
I try, I try
I try, you know I try
Chorus:
(Ryo-Z in background)
[Verbal] We used to play the games (The days)
[Illmari] Yuragani, my love (I praise)
[Wise] Hade, na paper chase (It's a shame)
[Teriyaki Boyz] Demo
And I swear she a riot folks
Right then and there I had an epiphany
Oh, oh-oh-oh
I make her say
P-p-p-poker face
P-p-poke her face
Me first!
She wanna have whatever she like
Yeah, the type that make you tell a bitch just dance
Fuck them other niggas cause she down for the stickin'
I'm hopin' she a rider
I ain't got a trip about them niggas who like her
I need to know, you down to do whatever?
Down to get it poppin? Down to get topless, ohh
I need to know, if you about cutting
Or you about frontin, baby I need to know
I spent my last 8 checks's on a neck-e-lace
So I better get some sex for this, shiit
She wanna sip up on the cris-e-cris
Like it's Christ-e-mas and I'm St. Nicholas
I got her and her sister innn
That white benz, dyke twins
And would I do em again? Hmmm, hmmm?
And it's no coke sniffin just juice and gin
Grey Goose to get you loose then hit the nigga producing
The track that got you movin, this track got you movin
So crazy you don't know what you doin
You been telling them jokes, and its not a rumor
I like a girl with a sense of humor
To give me head til it ache and it's not a tumor
Now if you got it you got it
I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye
The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye
I miss the old Kanye, straight from the 'Go Kanye
Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye
I gotta to say at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
I gotta to say, at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye
I even had the pink Polo, I thought I was Kanye
What if Kanye made a song, about Kanye?
Called ""I Miss The Old Kanye,"" man that would be so Kanye
I used to love Kanye
Verse 1:
Chorus 2x: (Kanye)
I gota love that's better then
You ever was, you've never been
No good for me, I guess I was
Just way too hood for you to be with
Yo I was doing a show with Kanye in the West
We in the game now, it makes perfect sense
She look goods, smell clean and she had fresh draws
Naw, that's too good to be
I feel like this
I feel like that
Your love is fadin'
I feel it's fadin'
I feel it...
I think I think too much
(I feel it)
I feel it
[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Know it ain't no wrong
I don't want to be liked
God is love
[Pre-Hook: Big Sean]
You lil stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You lil, you lil dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil stupid ass
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do
Yeah, Yeah
I can't say no
And now she find out what life is really worth
No to X rated
I am a god
Suh mi tek har outta bugah red and put her in a tall skirt
Yo mi tek har outta bugah red and put her in a tall skirt
Hurry up with my damn massage
Get the Porsche out the damn garage
Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
Cause kissing people ass is so unlike you
So here's a few hating-ass niggas who'll fight you
And here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you
Old niggas mentally still in high school
Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead?
[Pusha T]
Malice found religion, Tony found prison
Kentucky derby on the grill
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
I need more drinks and more lights
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
I think it's a couple more things they owe us
Don't let them make you believe
Don't-don't-don't
That I'm crazy, nigga I'm not crazy
My dome is where fate is
Pray to god that my arms reach the masses
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles
Rubberband together in cashless bundles
Divided only hustle remains
Making sense of it we hustle for change
Revolution ain't a game
It's another name
For life fighting
I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I love most, she had so much soul
She said ""Excuse me little homie, I know you don't know me
From that point I never blow her off
[Chris]
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again, coming home again
And you say Chi-City?
Chi-City, Chi-City
I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then? Yeah
But, my name is Wendy [windy], and
I like to blow trees"" and
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tell 'em off
And make 'em straighten up they hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she show me how to go downtown
And in the night-time, my face lit up, so astound
And I told her, in my heart is where she'll always be
She never mess with entertainers cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV, and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said ""Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me""
Cause I'm coming home again, coming home again
Chorus [Chris Martin]
Cause I'm coming home again
I'm in home again
And what I loved most she had so much soul
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
I'm on my way home
Tell em holla at ya boyyy and cause I'll be comin home
I'll be coming home
I met this girl when I was 3 years old
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees""
And from that point I never blow her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
I heard niggas hatin' on me from the sideline, mm, nice try
That's the tip, mhm
(Bitch, get off my pole)
Don't it taste like holy water?
Kiss it better, kiss it better
Make it wetter, make it wetter
Kiss it better, make it wetter
Hold tight, hold tight
When you're aiming for something I tell 'em
Hold tight, hold tight, hold tight
Forgive me if I ever doubted you
Please forgive me if I ever doubted you
Girl you can hold on longer
Honey wanna know the details about my ebony
Well that's XXL
I heard you stay in a metropolitan home
Chorus
I can hold my liquor
On Chicago, south of town
I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me
Cool cat, cool cat
Walkin' downtown
Walkin'-walkin' downtown
Walkin' downtown with the
High lights
Tell my baby I'm back in town
We only makin' the highlights
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to only be highlights
We only makin' the highlights slow motion, slow motion
(I want to play with you all night long
Then after the night)
You got to get up every morning
Highlights
Tell everybody I'm back in town
Can we play that back one time?
And after that night I'm gon' wanna play this shit back, I don't know
Sometimes I'm wishin' that my dick had GoPro
So I could play that shit back in slo-mo
I just shot an amateur video; I think I should go pro
I wanna play with you all night long
I bet me and Ray J would be friends
If we ain't love the same bitch
Yeah, he might have hit it first
Only problem is I'm rich
You've got to get up every morning
Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like uh, uh, uh..
when you hear this song you know it's on
(Do or Die)
Yo Kanye Blow the Hook you a genius boy
When you hear this song you know it's on
I swear your lovin got me so high I'm gone
Me and you babygirl like best friends
Let's ride hit the motion
I'm hittin through the back and curves
Your my latest, and my geatest
(Chorus)(x2)
I'm still tryin to hear this love what that do
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to be mine
We only making the highlights
One life, one night
Last night I saw you in my dreams
Now I can't wait to go to sleep
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
I was three years old, when you and I moved to the Chi
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
(Hey Mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (Hey Mama)
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)
This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take yall back to them better times
I'm finna talk about my mama if yall don't mind
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that mommy can't you see?
Cuz a nigga cheatin, telling you lies, then I started to cry
I said mommy I'mma love you till you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'mma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're, unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin loot
A livin legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)
We outta here baby!
Fresh off the plane, konitchiwa bitches
Talked it and he lived it, spitted then he shitted
But only I could come up with some shit like this
I done played the underdog my whole career
Heavy Hitter for life
Heavy hitters for life
You rappers think I give a f*ck about the way the day spent
Want to be on my album but don't want me on they sh*t
Everybody thought i was makin a compelation
I was really makin myself they competation
Fresh off the plane form the all star game
Bone girls on t.v so it's all star trains
Just picture man. No stichin man
Somethin for the phiends fresh out the kitchen man
Last 9/11 I was poor on a half till I floored up my math
Now it's Porsche 9/11 and I'm floorin the gas
Problems that i had no more
Well damn look at how everybody den changed
All my niggas is bout to have it made
Check it out
That's the day that I found heaven in the form of a girl
In the night I hear 'em talk,
The coldest story ever told,
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless...
How could you be so heartless... oh
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be sooooo
The coldest story ever told
To a woman so heartless
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
You got a new friend
Well I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely
They say that they don't see what you see in me
They don't know what we been through
So I got something new to see
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
Real life, I ask you tonight
How could you be so
I mean after all the things we got into
So you walk around like you don't know me
In the night, I hear 'em talk
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
Oh... how could you be so heartless?
How could you be so Dr. Evil?
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me, yo
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean after all the things that we've been through
Hey yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Hey yo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
You got a new friend, well I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely
You bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't gon' speak so
Why we up 3 A.M. on the phone
Why does she be so mad at me fo'?
Homie I don't know, she's hot and cold
In the night I hear them talk
Oh, how could you be so heartless?
Just remember that you talking to me though
You need to watch the way you talking to me yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayyo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayyo, I did some things but that's the old me
So you walk round like you don't know me
(Ain't no love, in the heart of the city)
(Ain't no love, in the heart of town)
First the Fat Boys break up, now every day I wake up
And my record's movin' out the store?
Get a couple of chicks, get 'em to try to do E
Hopefully they'll ménage before I reach my garage
Some nice cooked food, some nice clean drawers
And I pack heat like I'm the oven door?
And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tommorow today.
And I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow, today
But we'll find a way
Wake up, Mr. West!
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah
And I heard 'em say
Nothin's ever promised tomorrow, today
From the Chi, Like Tim, it's a Hardaway
Till this is in the name of love, like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise on the minimum wage?
And I know the government administer aids
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Abu Akhbar be throwin' some hot cause
Things we seein' on the screen not ours
But these niggas from the hood, so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it, uh
Adam Levine
And nothin's ever promised tomorrow today
And nothin' lasts forever, but be honest baby
It hurts, but it may be the only way
Uh, Yeah, Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah
[Piano drops]
From the Chi, like Tim its the Hard-a-way,
So I guess we just pray like the minister say,
Allah o Akbar and throw em some hot cars,
Things we see on the screen are not ours,
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far,
Where im from, the dope boys is the rock stars,
But they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars,
I guess they want us all behind bars.
I know it.
(ooooooooo)
And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
Will you cryyyyy
Since Pac passed away
So after walking through here I decided that I wanted to make sure for anyone that didn't have tickets tonight that you all could have tickets to the show. So anybody who wants to come tonight, you can have tickets for the entire office!
I'm about to go HAM
Hard as a mothaf***er let these n****s know who I am
It was all good just a week ago
N****s feel they selves
And then Watch The Throne drop
N****s kill they selves
What n****s gon' do Hov?
This a new crack on a new stove
I'm in the two-door, true that
N****s tellin' me ""You back"" (you back)
Like a n**** ever left up out this b****, huh?
And if life a b**** suck my dick huh?
And I bet she f***ed the whole clique, huh
By the way n****, you should f***in' quit, n****
Just forget it, you talk it, I live it
Like Eli I did it, jokes on you mothaf***er and I get it
No paper hoe, but you can have some more of me
Or-gy, or are we, speakin' metaphorically
Historically, I'm kickin' b****es out like Pam n****
Goin' HAM n****, me and Jigga
And a n**** still young, wanna have no kids
But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as s***
Had a few white girls, a**es flat a s***
But the head so good, damn a n**** glad he hit
Got 'em jumpin' out the building
Watch out below, a million out the door
F*** y'all mad at me for?
Y'all don't even know what I've been through
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, chop it and spray
Got the whole crowd like ""how ya do dat?""
Nigga you, get smacked 'til ya blue black
And ya crew, give me dap like true dat
Let's do it
Got the whole crowd like, how ya do dat?
It's hard to swallow at times, so take portions
Emcee species endangered like dolphins
Guerrilla monsoon rap all the shorties like, who dat?
Sister don't let your guard down
It's 3 am and we're just starting again
I got to pose
Ooouu hooouu, got nowhere
(girl singing)
[Beanie Sigel]
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
(wanna be good to you)
Good things don’t last
Heart made of stone
Hands made of hearth
Heartbroken so long
Good things don't last
Good things
You gotta
Brace for that fall
Made for this song
Made for so long
Oh oh, so long
Waves so far up
All the faces that I know
You make them sunny and new
I don't wanna say goodbye to you
So I'll just say good night to you
My people, no goodbyes to you
I'm just gonna say good night
Right now I can see it so vivid
And I'm the little kid tryna touch the exhibits
But it'll fade before I get to get a hold of that
Man I wish I could stop time like a photograph
Every joke that they told I'd know to laugh
Man, man I wouldn't let a moment pass
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin'
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin'
What do it mean when you never dream at all then
And you don't really know cause you can't recall them
It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to
People you never got a chance to say bye to
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams
Into real life, if you try to
I'm not sure anymore-more
Who is knocking at my door-door
Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it
Me and my grandparents on a field trid-ip
So close, but so far
And so far, no cigar
[Big Sean]
Uh 
Good morning 
[Produced By: Kanye West]
Uhh.. uhh
Good morning!
Good morning
Everything we dreamed of
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
Like we always do at this time
I go for mine, I gots to shine
Won't even get pulled over in they new V
The good life, it feel like Atlanta
It feel like L.A., it feel like Miami
It feel like N.Y., summertime Chi, ahh
So I roll through good
Y'all pop the trunk, I pop the hood, Ferrari
And she got the goods
And she got that ass, I got to look, sorry
Haters give me them salty looks, Lowry's
50 told me go 'head switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate
And watch the money pile up, the good life
I'ma, I'ma put shit down
Where we like the girls who ain't on TV
Now throw yo' hands up in the sky
I go for mine, I got to shine
I g-go for mine, I got to shine
Where niggas that sell D
The good life, let's go on a living' spree
Shit they say the best things in life are free
(Now throw your hands up in the sky)
Yo it's got to be cause I'm seasoned
Cause they got more (Ass than the models)
Where niggaz that sell D
The good life, so keep it coming' with the bottles
[Bridge 1: Kanye West]
(Can’t stop, you can’t stop)
We strivin home, gone
But it's too late, it's too late
You a big L, and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least 20 Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
Take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies
Says she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Friday's, I still have it my way
It's too late
Y'all don't want no prob from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern, and in turn
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn
Plus he already got three chil'run
Damn 'Ye, it'd be stupid to ditch you

Everybody's talking that I am not good enough
(I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ay)
You lookin' at who made me rich
(Go) go, go, go, go, go and on the count of three
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

You're the one I put the rock on
You're my diamond girl
I can be ya wake up reason daily
You can be my first and leading lady
I'ma make you happy that you waited
For me to settle down
Merry Christmas
I'm known for running my mouth
I will not be accountable for what comes out, uh
I dunno, I might have said it
And my jacket kinda fresh, bright red
And as usual, my pants tight-threaded
It seem like everybody dress tight now
And I just want my credit
I am the king and will not be headed
To the morgue no time soon, brethren
Being broke made my head hurt
So I need the bread or an Excedrin
That'll only get my engine revving
While y'all on 10, I'm on 11
Matter fact, I'm on this very second
I'm in first and y'all in second
And this verse only add to the freshness
Call to the club, tell them add to the guest list
What you think? Way more bitches?
I can never be too big for my britches
Y'all motherfuckers know who this is
I'm gifted
I'm armed with pens, I've got my rhymes
Whatever comes, I write it down
So knock me out and shoot me down
With mics in hand, we'll stand against the test of time
I want you to be my ghetto señorita
And drive my two-seaters and hold my heaters
He said ""Dog, slow down like Brand Nubian now""
Shorty gettin it in with me (uh-huh)
Gon' getcha, gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
Gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some

GET EM HIGH

My freshman year I was goin through hell, a problem
Still I, built up the nerve to drop my ass up outta collllllll-ege
My teacher said I'se a loser, I told her why don't you kill me
I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna folllllllllll-ow
My heart, and if you follow the charts, to the plaques or the stacks
You ain't gotta guess who's back, you see
I'm so shy that you thought it was bashfull but this
And I will, cut your girl like Pastor Tro
And I don't, usually smoke but pass the 'dro
And I won't, give you that money that you askin fo'

Ya see, I'm just a regula nigga an I'm keepin' it real (Hey, Hey)
Kanye: T's like dese cat's dat I see all be tryin ta front
If ya see me on the block, I'm just out havin' fun
When I see a cop crusin' I don't take off on a run
Feel that bulge in my pocket, that's me, girl, tain't no shotgun
My teeth ain't gold, dey a natural white
An' I'll defend myself, but I aint lookin' ta fight
Some dudes say dey ballin', but that aint me

It's funny
[Asher Roth]

From a freeway trailer
Separate loans, separate codes
Cause dead right can go wrong
Put your head on my shoulders
To never wanna let go
Just put your head on my shoulders
I will straighten out, for you
And what we need to do in the game
Ayy, y'all heard about the good news?
Y'all sleeping on me, huh? Had a good snooze?
Wake up, nigga, wake up
We bout to get this paper
Hands up, we just doing what the cops taught us

I done asked twice now
Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, mayne (ever, mayne)
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call

(Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)
Drake
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first-name basis
In your city faded off the brown, Nino
She insists she got more class, we know
Swimming in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo
Dropped a mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd a thought a country-wide tour be the outcome
Labels want my name beside an X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hitlist
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness
Bitches
Ever, ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams: Big fame, big chains
I stuck my d**k inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I could make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you could call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they gon' build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, what, nothin'
Nah, superbad chicks giving me McLovin'
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no, you fuckin' wasn't
""Uh, you such a fuckin' loser
You ain't even go to class, Bueller""
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
'Member she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasing the stardom'll turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull they cameras out, and God damn, they snap
I used to want this thing forever, you can have it back
I want this shit forever man
I want this shit forever, man
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
She insist she got more class, we know
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard, all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
Until the blue and white (po po! po po! po po!)
Heartless females that wanna ride in em
Felt the southside venom in raw hides and denim
Pimp minds collide wit em, a system that tries victims
We living in, my man in the fast lane pivoting
On the block it ""Jump Off"" like Kim and them
Call my man cuzo, like I'm kin to him
It's all good in the hood, like raps and gems
Ruhumun katmanlarını açığa çıkarıyorum
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
See, before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
Had more than another episode
Asking me why the hell I text in code
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
But I'mma have the last laugh in the end
Yeah, I'mma have to laugh in the end
Sometimes I wish that I could fly away
I been waiting for a minute
I been living without limits
As far as my business
I'm the only one that's in control
For my children
I will die for those I love
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul
The layers to my soul
Wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Let me take you to flight school
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's department
And the weather so breezy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
Damn, these niggas got me
But I never thought that you would take it this far
She don't believe in shootin' stars
Straight from a page of your favorite author
Man why can't life always be this easy
I get a call like where are you Yeezy
Till I get flashed by the paparazzi
As I recall, I know you love to show off
I know it's been a while
But she believe in shoes & cars
You more like ""I love to start shit""
I'm more of the, trips to florida
Order the hors d'oeuvre, views of the Water
Try to hit you with a ‘Oeur de Whopdee'
Damn, these niggas get me
I hate these niggas more than the Nazis
[Dwele]
But what do I know? Flashing lights, lights
She don't believe in shooting stars
You more like ""love to start shit""
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
I get a call like, ""Where are you Yeezy?""
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
'til I got flashed by the paparazzi
I hate these niggas more than a Nazi
You really want to know about a day in that shit
I'm inspired when people don't like me
Man, the drama is so enticing
I might just bite a motherfucker like Tyson
Keep tellin' me you got a man, but he can't do what I can
Let me show you what you've been missing
I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out
No matter how much I've tried
I got it all in my mind, ah uh
I can't figure it out
I can't, I can't lie to you, ah
""I can fight with the best""
Don't let 'em hold you down nigga
""But I can only go""
You can go another round nigga
""So many rounds""
Huh
I ain't goin nowhere
World's, world's, world's famous
I know the city getting ready for me
Money never made me
Make me do something? Nah, can't make me
Even if the money low, can't pay me
Even if the money low, can't play me
Pablo bought a Roley and a rottweiler
Seem like the more fame, I only got wilder
Might not come when you want but I'm on time
I rip every one of these motherfuckers down
Aye, rah, rah, rah
Rah, rah
Fire up, tweaking
You're my freak dreams
Bad bitch, you dig that
Get stacks, drive cars
Tits out, oh shit
My dick out, can she suck it right now?
Fuck, can she fuck right now?
Can you bring your price down?
This that rap god shit nigga
Close eyes, see things
Whip that, bitch out
Lil Boosie with the wipe down
A little woozy but a nice night
What the, what the fuck right now?
What if we fuck right now?
What if we fucked right in the middle
Of this motherfuckin' dinner table
What if we just fucked up this whole party
Would we be the life of the whole party?
Shut down the whole party
Would everybody stop buggin'?
Can you remind me again why we in this shit?
Since when was making music about getting rich?
Remind me why we in this shit - 
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam
You're the only power
Nothing unwanted
I don't even want to talk about it
Beautiful morning, hear the sound of my moaning babe
Beautiful morning, hear the sound of moaning babe
I just want to feel liberated, I, I, I
If I ever instigated I’m sorry
You're the only power that can
You're the only power that can, ohhhh
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh
[Future]
If young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you
Just want to feel liberated, I, I, I
Tell me who in here can relate
Now if I fuck this model
And she just bleached her asshole
And I get bleach on my T-shirt
I'mma feel like an asshole
I was high when I met her
We was down to Tribeca
She get under your skin if you let her
She get under your skin if you-uh
I don't even want to say nothing
Everybody gon' say something
I'd be worried if they said nothing
Remind me where I know you from?
She looking like she owe you some
You know just what we want
I want to wake up with you in my eyes
Tell me who in here can relate, I, I, I
(Perfect)
Part 2

Beautiful morning, you're the sun in my morning babe
You're the only power (power)
If I ever instigated I'm sorry
She gone start lyin if you let her
Ion even wanna be about it
Man I can understand how it might be
Frate' vuoi i soldi o la fama?
For all my Southside niggas that know me best
I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex
Why? I made that bitch famous (God damn)
I made that bitch famous
For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous (God damn)
They mad they're still nameless (Talk that talk, man)
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
But we still hood famous (God damn)
Yeah we still hood famous
I loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
Got the key to the city, the streets on lock
Swizz told me let the beat rock
Why? I made that bitch famous
I be Puerto Rican day parade floatin'
That Benz Marina Del Rey coastin'
Last month I helped her with the car payment
Young and we alive, whoo!
We never gonna die, whoo!
I just copped a jet to fly over personal debt
Put one up in the sky
The sun is in my eyes, whoo!
Woke up and felt the vibe, whoo!
This is family business
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
No one wants to fall out of heaven
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
[mumbling]
Faithful to the end
Ain't nobody watchin'
I just fade away
Roll up, roll up
Hold up, hold up
Po' up, po' up
I'ma rock the boat
Work the middle 'til it hurt a little
Fuckin' with a real ass nigga
Fuck how you feel ass nigga
Bitch better act like you know better
When no one ain't around
Beatzy Beatzy Beatzy
Dirt and grime and filth inside
The story of my lifetime
Of cheating, stealing, never feeling
Pain of a brother, your dirty mother
(Perfect!)
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
Ha, ha, ha, look how far we are, are, are, are, are, are, are
(Yo!)
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I feel so accomplished
If Nike ain't have Drizzy, man they wouldn't have nothin', woo!
If Nike ain't have Don C, man they wouldn't have nothin', ooh!
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, they line up for days
I stuck to my roots, I'm like Jimmy Fallon
Every time I talk they say I'm too aggressive
I was out here spazzin', all y'all get the message?
Nike, Nike treat employees just like slaves
10 thousand dollar fur for Nori, I just copped it (Yo!)
I done wore designers I won't wear again
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground
Tired of being cramped up in the house
We were simply celebrating life
Started dancing with this model chick
And ended up at the Embassy
With this pretty little thing from Memphis, Tennessee
Hung over from all the drinks I had
And now I'm telling my story to you
It was a one night extravaganza I had one too many drinks
It's the R.O.C. mami, sing our lullaby
C'mon!
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit
You should come, hang with me, basically
Hold up, skip all the singin' let's get right tonight mami
Mr. West what do you think is the best?
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with
Damn, here we go again
Here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am
I'll never be picture perfect Beyoncé
I never be as laid back as this beat was
Fake ass facade that they couldn't keep up
Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam
Now everything I'm not, made me everything I am
People talking shit, but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am
Be light as Al B., or black as Chaun-cey
Remember him from Blackstreet, he was as black as the street was
I never could see why people reach a
You see how I creeped up
You see how I played the big role in ""Chicago"" like Queen Latifah
Let me know if you feel it man
Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
Maybe they seen me on the videos
Damn I should have listened
Let's go!
Don't stop baby, Don't stop me
I just penetrate and switch, hands in that bitch
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
–Chorus: Kanye West–
Kill they kids, tell that kid, hands in that bitch
I could stay here forever and none of y'all would hear a word from me
Yeah, this could be eternity
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you
(What the hell are you waiting for?)
After me, there shall be no more
It's my time I need you to roar
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
[Ellen DeGeneres:]
Yes.
Yeah.
Their eyes cast down fixed upon the ground
Relax yourself or we'll back ya down
[Consequence] 
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down
Homie check it out I got her mesmerized
Street poetry is how ya boy get paid
And I wear no Escalade, metallic, black or beige
Yo when I walk up in the club you know I do not pay
Aiiyo my man Kanyeezy he got something to say
No they don't die
You were always mine
Your touch magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
You're from a whole other world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction
Your touch so foreign
Extraterrestrial
You're so supersonic
Stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic
Yeah, I know what you like
Cause you the type of danger we gain in yo
Just to mess with these drunk and hot girls
She go through too much bullshit
You drunk and hot girl
You drunk and hot girl We go through too much bullshit
We go through too much bullshit just to mess with these drunk and hot girls 
She go through too much bullshit just to mess with these drunk and hot girls

Through too much shit (She's sucking having game but happy as) 
To mess, mess with (She's sucking having game but happy as) 
These drunk, all of these drunk and hot girls 
[Murphy Lee] 
It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
Drive slow, homie
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
Drive slow homey
[Kanye:]
One of my best friends from back in the day
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'd leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
See back back then then if you had a car
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homey
Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey
Down the street form Calumet a school full of stones
Walk around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Dayton's in his hand
Keys in his hand reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Alesis he had dreams of Caprice's
Drove by the teachers even more by police's
How he get that cash today his father passed away
Left him with a little somthin 16 he was stuntin
Al B Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit lakeshore girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway go at least bout 80
Boned so much that summer even had him a baby
You were the Chi town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin a baby
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
They had the Lincoln's and Aurora's we were hurting them all
But dawg fuck all that flirting I'm trying to get in some draws
So put me on with these hoes homey's
He said don't rush to get grown drive slow homey
Drive slow homie
Drive slow...
Ya never know homey about these hoes homey
Ya need to pump your breaks and drive slow homey

Artist: Kanye West
Album: College Dropout Unreleased
Dreaming of your love
What these bitches want from a nigga?
On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'
It's like a lot of games bein' played
It's like a lot of games are bein' played
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now
I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
You ready?
Heartbreaker, dream maker
Love taker don't you mess around with me, you're a

(Woo!) That's rare nigga, (Woo!) Ric Flair nigga
(Woo!) The power's in my hair nigga, (Woo!) I give this beat the chair nigga
SoHo or Tribeca, three hoes, trifecta
Dope money, hope money, Hublot, my watch better
My pen's better, you don't write, trendsetter, you clone-like
Pay homage or K's vomit, ungrateful niggas, I don't like
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like (Bang, bang)
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like (Bang, bang)
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like (Bang, bang)
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like (This Chicago, nigga!)
They smile in my face is what I don't like
They steal your whole sound, that's a soundbite
The media crucify me like they did Christ
They want to find me not breathing like they found Mike (Whoa!)
A girl'll run her mouth only out of spite (Whoa!)
But I never hit a woman never in my life (Eh!)
I was in too deep like Mekhi Phif' (Eh!)
In that pussy so deep I could have drowned twice (Whoa!)
Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice (Whoa!)
Eating good, vegetarian with the brown rice (Eh!)
Girls kissing girls, cause it's hot, right? (Eh!)
But unless they use a strap-on then they not dykes (Whoa!)
They ain't about that life, they ain't about that life (Whoa!)
We hanging out that window it's about to be a Suge night (Eh!)
Free Bump J, real nigga for life (Eh!)
Shoutout to Derrick Rose, man that nigga nice (Whoa!)
Shout out to L-E-P, Jay Boogie right? (Whoa!)
Chief Keef, King Louie, this is Chi, right? right?!
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like
Don't like, don't like, a snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Fake Gucci, that's that shit I don't like
Smoking on this dope, higher than a kite
This bitch gon' love me now, she gon' let me pipe
So if you made that money, boy
They say don't you forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em
PEACE
Peace, couldn't afford the S-Class
Back when my ATM was crazy slim
Make her open wide like she made me her dentist
Hit the mall
We ball til we fall
After we hit dont call
Fill your lives with nothing but lies
And I would like to apologize
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf

(Trina)
If you want me
I know, I know
Some places we can go, some places we can go
Do you wanna ride with me
She told me that she only do girls
But since she met a player like me
Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip
Don't let me into my zone, you haters leave me alone
Dip, you dip, I dip, dip, you dip, I dip, you dip
Don't let me into my zone, don't let me into my zone
I say, don't let me into my zone, don't let me into my zone
I can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my I, I can't live my
My favorite girl wanna leave me just because I got a girlfriend
My white girl wanna move back to Michigan
I want a good girl, she want a gentleman
We sayin' the same thing like a synonym
[Drake]
I love it, girl 
[Jamie Foxx] 
I love it, girl
And if one of these websites get the info
I just hit Alt, Tab
I should just call cabs
And bring 'em both here to the condo
Yeah, normally it ain't a question
We would cross paths like an intersection
But she just too far away for affection
So I pray that we never lose a connection
Cause I remember Stacy, she prolly hate me
She used to threaten she had a man to replace me
She talk that shit, I just hit the escape key
And then she get mad and wanna go and erase me
And I remember Amy, she used to AIM me
She said I'm too wild, she wanna tame me
I told her even Photoshop couldn't change me
End the night with a kiss and a bye bye
No strings attatched, your love is so Wi-Fi
The way you bring your light into this room
The way your lips looks after you apply the gloss
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl
[The Dream]
I wanna see what's under there baby
Who's that peekin' in my window
You should let some more skin show
We can work it out, no Nintendo
Switchin' in between two convos
She stayed up late and used to blame me
But you-you-you, you got me open girl, why lie
We ain't even tryna settle, so why try
[Refrain: Jamie Foxx]
Uh, I love it, girl
The way your legs light up when they're in them shoes
Ah, I love it, girl, girl
You look right in the screen then take it o-off, off
She's my digital, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
My homies never see you
But I always got you right here for me
Tucked, in my Louis computer bag
Wherever you are, I could be
I type you a message full of X's and O's
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
I know two girls that done did it before
But I wonder if they know that we did it before
If the other girl know that we did it before
Shit I wonder if they know that we did it before
[chorus]
Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived, cuz
It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe does
I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than u ever thought up
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder
- its for yourself that's important
If a stripper named Porscha and u get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......
I was sick about awards
Couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them
30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them
What more can you ask for?
Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
And throw a tantrum like he is 3 years old
""Diamonds are forever forever forever""
Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today
Over there, they die from what we buy from drugs
Vegas on acid,
he write his own rhymes, so sort of
so its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Excuse me,
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Who complains about what he is owed?
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
Have no fear that they might
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Vegas on acid
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Excuse me
(Forever, forever)
(Forever, forever, forever)
Forever ever, forever ever
Ever ever, ever ever, ever ever, ever ever, ever ever
I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
The international assholes nah
They're all I need to please me
They can't stimulate or tease me
Throw ya diamonds in the sky
If you feel the vibe
(Diamonds are forever forever forever)
The ROC is still alive
Everytime I rhyme
For ever ever? for ever ever? ever ever?
Ever ever? ever ever? ever ever? ever ever?
Good Morning, this ain't Vietnam still
People lose hands, legs, arms for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I speak of Diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin bout the ones that be glown
I'm talkin bout Rocafella, my home, my chain
See, a part of me sayin' keep shinin',
How? when I know of the blood diamonds
Though it's thousands of miles away
Over here, its a drug trade, we die from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus Piece was so harmless
'til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person's soul to rock that gold
Spend ya whole life tryna get that ice
How could somethin' so wrong make me feel so right, right?
'fore I beat myself up like Ike
We the cause of all the commotion
Your mouth running, but where is you going?
What is you smoking, man? That ain't potent
What is you talking, man? That ain't important
We in this party and nobody invited me
But it don't matter cause I stay on my fresh prince
Maxin', relaxin, shootin' some pool and
Playing some b-ball outside of the school and
Girls with they top off outside of the pool and
Whips with the drop off outside of the Louvre
You just look stupid to be ignoring
And parties at Richie is getting risky
Victoria's Secret show, they miss me
Voices in my head, I need choices in my bed
It's just me and my bad bitch
So you can say I'm on my Brad Pitt
Back to the la familia I'm aligned with
Before I betray them I slit my wrists
At the top is just us nigga
Cause I don't really trust niggas
And we made it through the hurricane
So celebrate and light the Mary Jane
We gon' make it, that's on everything
Truest girls get half naked, every spring
They saying, ""Hey Kanye
Cause my verses got pain, Chocolate Rain
So many lines, you photograph and it make arms break
On the radio, man I miss myself
I need to just step back and kiss myself
Baby, just step up and kiss the belt
Somebody pour her another cup
Is it too much to ask you keep your diamonds up?
I swear until my time is up
My style is sex in the shower, fresh as fuck
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Illuminati, High society
We going crazy and I always use my best sense
The Delorean parked in front of Armani emporium
Ah, get out my fucking head
We need you to go deeper than Tay Zonday,""
A little lower.. that's what's up
So shine bright tonight you and I
Eye to eye so alive
Make you forget the way you felt before
Your my diiiiiiamond girl
Your the one, I put the rock on
I'm waiting in my hotel room
Yeah, I think she'll be able to tell soon
Your friends always tying up every line on your phone
By now so you go sleeping with them clowns, they are no relief
She spoke her piece, I know, capisce
So love must be let go, released
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
I hate niggas, but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me, her second son
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
What I'm dealing with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
All my shit designer
I fucked your bitch in Cavalli
I fucked your bitch in Versace, nigga
Oh, no
(I miss that pussy, that pussy, that pussy, that pussy)
Wake up motherfuckers it's Weezy, you got a problem?
Shiny black coupe at night look like a goblin
The watered down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
Twisted fictions, sick addictions
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Human
Work is never over

And when I die I'm going back to the heavens I fell from

The more you try to erase me
The more, the more
The more that you appear

E parlo e vesto
Mangio e cresco
Come un criminale
Mentre esco e torno presto
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, get it right
They deal it for real
That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
They wanna pack us all in a box like styrofoam
Who gave Saddam anthrax?
George Bush got the answers

My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Baby I know we said it's best we don't talk no more
But I got to get this off my chest about all the shit I've been hearing babe I
I thought you were that ride or die
You will never leave my side
I even made you out to be the woman that I will be with for life I took in
Your kids did everything that you wanted me too
Heard about frontin' on radio and the fuse
If you were gonna tell it then you told instead of making me the bad guy
If you got nothing good to say then don't say nothing
Cause if I really start talking it'll be something
So you cheated, I cheated
So be it
We need to leave it alone
Move on

[Usher] Hold up
[Operator] Hello, you got a collect call from Clinton Correctional Facility will you accept the charges?
[Usher] Yes, I'll accept it, what's up?
[Shyne - rapping on the phone]
Sittin' in my cell, head about to burst
Wouldn't be alive if I didn't shoot first
Had it made, sorry for the ricochet
But I'd be in the grave if I didn't let it spray
I never said that I was perfect
Nobody walking on this earth is
That night, I would've got murdered
If I ain't grab the ratchet and let them cowards have it
Uh, listen up, listen up, listen up, world
Listen up, listen up, listen up, world
Uh, I gotta confess
This is the hottest remix I ever did in my life
So So Def
These are my confessions, just when I thought I said all I can say
These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all (all)
That's on you bitch
That's on you
You know one thing that's great about that problem
Fucked three white girls this evening
Memories made in the coldest winter
I told you mahfuckas it was more than the music
In the projects one day, to Project Runway
We done heard all that loud-ass talking, we're used to it
I'm from where shorties fucked up, double-cupped up
Might even kill somebody and YouTube it
To whoever think their words affect me is too stupid
And if you can do it better than me, then you do it!
We flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, we made it to the Paris news!
Don't talk about style cause I embarrass you
Can't a young nigga get money any more? (ah)
Come to meet me without no drawers?
Only nigga I got respect for is Wiz
[Sandman]
Wondering why your dawgs don't say hi
I've been looking in the church and you're messed up
And you wonder why it's gone in the nightlife
Clique, clique, clique clique
Black-on-black crime
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
What of the dollar you murdered for?
Is that the one fighting for your soul?
I tell a bad bitch do whatever I say
My block behind me like I'm coming out the driveway
It's grind day, from Friday, to next Friday
Freaky women I be feeling from the bank accounts I'm filling
What a feeling, ah man, they gotta be
Ain't nobody fresher than my mothafuckin' clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
As I look around, they don't do it like my clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
And all these bad bitches, man, they want the
They want the, they want the
[Nas] Classic
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is?
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin' it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain't ballin'
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe's right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus
Merry Christmas to all, and all a good night
Huh, now we all livin' the good life
Yeah, though it's forty below the wind chill
And we wipin' snow up off the windshield
It's still, wonderful night to be alive, baby
And I'm, so happy I'm with my baby
Rushin' for the mall, don't trip, you know I drive crazy
The streets lit up, it feel like Christmas officially
Told her that “You the star at the top of my Christmas tree”
My only question is, “Where my presents?”
She said, “Shhh,” she got a gift for me that ain't for the kids to see
Well, I like the way you think, mami
Now pour some more eggnog in you drink, mami
And we a little late with the Christmas gifts
You've been a bad girl, give Santa three kisses
Merry X-mas, Santa Claus cherry X6
They ain't hear my rain, dear
Make it snow on the next chick
Got enough toys, wondering what's my next pick
Before my exit, it get diamond rolex reckless
Big bags, Got everything on the checklist
Necklace, Baguette wrist
Pockets fat, they Precious
Give Ma a peck kiss, look and tell her she precious
Lighting up the sour, this tree give me the best gifts
And I remember when I couldn't play Santa Claus
No reindeers, just horses and a Panamera Porcshe
We on two fifth shopping, what the damage cost
I got your fam while you bidding in the can up north
You want the thigh high spikes with the red bottoms
Let's make a toast cause Christ is born
Yeah, mom and dad I won't be home for the holidays
In the city that's so pretty
Where the hustlers dash through the snow without a sleigh
I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don't know why I keep calling (why I keep calling) 
All of these girls at my shows they loving me 
But I don't know why I keep calling 
Why I keep calling you 
Born there that's home there in my lifetime
In the summer, winter, fall, or spring
I love it when my bitches and my ballers sing
And you say Chi city
Mayonnaise colored Benz I push miracle whips
(Quavo)
Pray for me
I'm about to hit the Ye button
I don't wanna say nothin' wrong
But it'd be wrong if I ain't say nothin'
Imagine if I ain't say somethin'
Wasn't nothin', you could say nothin'
I done lost and made money
Now I'm makin' somethin' they can't take from me
Now I'm fresh out of debt in this mothafucka!
And they still ain't ready yet for a mothafucka!
Yeezy might have to go and put his Louis on
I'm 'bout to go Gucci in the Gucci store
Fresh out the feds in this mothafucka
And they still ain't ready yet for a mothafucka
Gucci Mane and I'm 'bout to put my Yeezys on
Now that Gucci's home, it's over for you Gucci clones
1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
Look, I say a prayer for my enemies
They cannot slow down what's meant for me
Funny how they come around like I can't see through their secret identities
Lately it's all about Zen and me
Subtractin' the negative energy
With the family, turn your ass to a memory
My niggas team of the century
I blow the check up, detonation
Kill 'em one by one, Final Destination
Time my destination
I got guardian angels all around a nigga, that's deflecting Satan
I'm a mothafuckin' champion
This right here the fuckin' anthem
I can't dap you without hand san'
I don't know where your dirty ass hands been
I wake up to like a hundred texts
Championship team, but we can't cut the net
She all off in my jersey lookin' underdressed
I'm finna buy this bitch a Honda CRX
Round and round they go, round and round they go
Rather be trappin' up out of the bowl
Then to get down with a ho
Til I pull out the chopper, start blastin'
'Round and 'round they go
I took a nap in the pulpit
I never like how a suit fit
I got a pocket full of money
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?
Mmm hmm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this
Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little somethin', show you how we live
Everybody want it but it ain't that serious
You don't see just how wild the crowd is?
You don't see just how fly my style is?
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know I just want it better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But every time I wanted, layaway or a deposit
My daddy'd say ""When you see clothes close your eyelids""
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son
In the movie I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
'Cause every summer he'd get some
Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he'd send me back to school wit' a new wardrobe and hey! hey! hey! hey!
I think he did, when he packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little somethin' show you how we lived
Everything I wanted man it seemed so serious
When it feel like livin's harder than dyin'
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)
Just a lil' somethin' show you how we live
Mm hm, that's that shit
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy
[Bridge: Kanye West] 
Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Cause we Certified Gangstas
I need you
You can help me just breathe, breathe
Cubans on me like I'm Castro
Dope money, Pablo
Hit your bitch with a backstroke
Spanish bitch, JLo
Astronaut, take off
John Travolta, face off
In the kitchen, have a bake off
She gon' snort her whole damn face off
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing
Old folks talking bout back in my day
Wait till I get my money right
You can't tell me nothing
Excuse me, is you saying something?
If I had a billion dollars (YEAHHHHHHHHHH)
Grand piano, might learn to play (Ha Ha!)
I hit the strip club and I blew bout forty (DAMN!)
Patron got me so confused (fused)
Until I stumbled outside and I made the news
Fresh nine piece, yeah them wings is cajun
Never seen me in the kitchen nigga, I am amazing (nah)
Well, fuck it I'm rich then
If balling is a crime, fuck it I'm hit then
The insane dough, hey, fuck it I'm sick then
Somebody call me a shrink
And I know they hate it
On the all night flight
Wassup?
La La La La (Hey!)
La La La La (Yeah!)
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing (HA HA!)
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
The drama, people suing me
I'm just saying how I feel man
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from
La, la, la, la wait till I get my money right
La, la, la, la then you can't tell me nothing right
Excuse Me, is you saying something?
Let up the suicide doors
I know that Jesus died for us
Class started 2 hours ago, oh am I late?
You know I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Wait 'til I get my money right
Man it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message
And what I do, act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My Momma couldn't get through to me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hillman
La, la, la la
This is my life homie, you decide yours
I'm on T.V. talking like it's just you and me
La la la la
But I couldn't tell you who decide wars
Can't stop, you can't stop
Can't, can't stop, you can't stop my love
Can't stop, you can't stop my love
(You know we)
To grow old
In my arms
Hmmm, when I walk in the room they can't look in my eyes
(You know who the fuck you is)
People talk shit about me and they know that I know
Cause when I walk in the room they can't look in my eyes
Can you be (real?)
Can you be way up?
I came back for you
Let me call some, call some girls that I knowww, knowww
I don't mean the bougie ones from befohhh, 'fohhh
I need some girls that's really down to get lowww, lowwww
It's ya boy Kanye to The
The Roc is in the building right now
We smoked out
And I don't even talk like that
When I get my Bentley they gon call me Bent-lino
Lot of shit changed since I hooked with Jay-Z yo
For the tracks I done got 800 C-notes
So glad I ain't take the drive to Home Depot
Fuckin with my girl today around three-oh
My man said let's call some girls that we know
Even if a modelin chick sucked my dick
It wouldn't make me now feel so sick, just because
They came over to cheer me up
Smoked, drink, and yeah we fucked
No matter what they do it can't be enough
Uhh
We gon' paint the town tonight
They gon' faint and fall in line (yeah)
Faded cause we're out of sight
Cool Outrageous Lovers Of Uniquely Raw Style
Shawty Snap (Yeah)
Ooooh Oooh (Yeah)
Snap Ya Fingers
Do Ya Step
You Can Do It All By Yourself
(Plain Pat, what up?)
Excuse me but this verse
Has not been Russell Simmons approved uh-uh
You won't see it on Run's house uh-uh
You won't see it at a nun's house
My New York nigga said he heard it at son's house
Talkin' 'bout how this ho is poor as my low is
Baby is my Lois, maybe I'm just bogus
Cause she don't wan't you to buy her a drank
Swizz said she ain't got no money in the bank
And she be standin' there, cause it's cameras
Tryin' to show yo legs off, you ain't Amerie
If I fall in love, a girl gon' live on rodeo
Until that day-o, she take the monorail
And I don't want no girl that will answer to ""ayo""
Make it more harder, make me put some work in
You get to flirtin', play her just perfect
Fuck a drank, I'mma buy tha bar if ya worth it
Baby girl, what's your name?
So fly on, fly high, come on Cupid hit a bulls-eye
Please don't let me down this time
[Talib Kweli]
Stop
You got it (come on ma)
Brown sugar let me see you shake it out
(if you invited me)
Listen, yo
C'mon (Give it to me)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
We gon' to mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say, I have to say
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me
There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Tracklist TBA
Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant
And it's still about the Benjamins
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named Cinnamon
More chips than Pentium
What'cha gon' buy next? Whatever new trend it is
I'm tryin' to spend my stacks
And I'm so broke I look back like ""Damn, was I on crack?""
What the hell was wrong with me dog?
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya d's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like ""Peace out!""
Surely you'll break my heart but I'll be there beside you
(She said ""Don't break my heart"")
Love to give
Now ain't that about a bitch
And I'mma talk shit until I'm out of hits
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)
What you doing in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walking 'round, always mad reputation
Leave a pretty girl sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I'll turn the plane 'round, your ass keep complaining
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans
Uh, this that prom shit
This that what we do, don't tell your mom shit
This that red cup, all on the lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain't getting checks)
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back
It's like I wanna spit something written
But keep forgetting
So I guess it's from the heart from the start
Played my part
Seemed like I just wasn't reaching the charts
5000 hours, rewritting Power
Over and over
Some nights sober, some nights gone off the Henny as usual
So unusual to be in this position
Everybody playin him, truth be told
And oh Mos Def ran to my home
And said they gon have yo ass gone
Light jokes, you keep playin with them white folks
They gon' test your urine
Cut all the sponsorship for the touring!
I dont know, ask, ask Hennesy (thats Coca-Cola)
Lets keep this shit real!
Now who the realest
Everybody feel this
And everyday of my life, people try to tell me that I hate the whites
I go to sleep and deal wit it every night
And wake up every morning
Its no verse that would reverse the-
In print or in cursive
They curse the name, or maybe call me Kane
Thats what I have to deal wit real shit
Yall dont even understand, what it take to be a real man
A black man interested in art, speaking from the heart and playin' my part
From my last breath
Didn't even know I afford that
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And came out of your body
AAAA!!!
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing
Let's play the blame game for sure
My by-any-means on
Claiming I'm overreactin'
Everybody
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
Baby we livin' in the moment
And you know it, and you know it
If I knew what I knew in the past
300 bitches, where's the Trojans?
Bittersweet 
You're gonna be the death of me 
I don't want you but I need you 
I love you and hate you at the very same time 
See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad 
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says 
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says 
God talk to me now, this is an emergency 
Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time
See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God talk to me now, this is an emergency
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurtin' me
We breakin' up again
We makin' up again
But we don't love no more
I guess we fuckin' then
Bitch better have my money!
Like bra, bra, bra
Pay me what you owe me
Bitch better have my (bitch better have my)
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
Who will dance on the floor in the round
Hollywood lights
Used to be Dame and Big's brother
So mad, you wanna start boxin'
Slicin' and dicin'
I'm not Bill Cosby to 'em
And I ain't Bing Crosby
The image and the style that you're used to doin'
When people usually do music
I am a visionary, Christian soldier, don't confuse it
Uh, that's the next president, arson
Confidence and esteem, American dream
Backing drums by DJ Premier

To the Good Life, we GOOD music
Man, I wake up to a wet dream
Every day's a Friday and every nights a sex scene
Every week is fashion week and every day I'm pressed clean
I'm headed to the ball, me and three prom queens
My life's prom night and guess who's the Prom King
They having a kissing fight and I'm Don King
Everybody know I'm coming soon like LeBron's ring
Whoever told you sky's the limit is looking dumb
Cause I'm 22 and I'm moonwalking on the sun
Oh thats your girl?
You might find banana clips 'cause it's Guerilla warfare
Many tell me I'm the man I ain't made it yet
Won't stop til I get that Mercedes 700 CLK and Mercedes ain't made it yet
[Cyhi Da Prince]
Better known as MJ with the big nose
I swear your artist couldn't see me on his tip toes
Only on TV I gotta take a quick pose
Let me stop I forgot this was a big show
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear, I can spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayyyyy

Let em put you on peep it though
I ain’t even want to freak the hoe
I spit it
I spit it so you could feel it
These hoes is all the same
See these sheets is like the street you gotta stay strapped up
Put that bitch on now what she lying about
Talking about how she late and how she eat a lot
See she eat a lot cause she smoke weed a lot
Boniquan now my shorty looking fine: Puerto Rican
When she told me it was mine I damn near fainted
I ain't even want to freak the hoe
She tried to pop my pockets before I even got paid
You could learn something from her but you might get burned from her
We smoked a couple of dimes I hit it a couple of times
Now she say she pregnant and its mine
But she started paging me like every single day
She said her man going away the judge gave him three
Ayy girl, I tried to make you my baby
Ayy girl, instead you make me go crazy
Cause baby, you're awesome
Alright, alright, alright
Stop everything you're doing now
So awesome
You look too good to be at work
You feel too good to ever hurt
You can't be still
I gotta live, I gotta love
You don't need to listen to your manager
You're way too hot for them to handle you
Cause I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new
I swear these bitches funny, hahaha
Hahaha, hahaha
You're the one who started it
But she don't drive
We can't even sit & talk
Witout chu arguin
Girl you must be outta your mind
Why are you so paranoid?
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
Anyway, they don't know you like I do
(Never know)
Anyone but him
Who's gonna take you home
If it isn't me
With school boy fists, we can take this outside
But knowing my luck, that fuck would win
Don't you let out that antidote
Don't you open up that window
Poppin' pills is all we know
In the hills is all we know (Hollywood!)
It's lowkey at the night show
At the night show
There'll never be another you
It don't really matter what you do
I'm just saying
They ain't never been up in your shoes
Baby you ain't got nothing to prove
Another Summer
Breathe in this feeling
American, American oxygen
Breathe out, breathe in
American oxygen, woah
Every breath I breathe
Chasin' this American Dream
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire, woah
American oxygen
Breathe in, this feeling
Oh say, can you see - this is the American Dream
Take me on a trip I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy
I'm liking this American boy, American boy
Amen
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing [x2]
It's amazing
It's amazing, I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening
I'm exhausted, barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
I'm a monster, I'm a killer
I know I'm wrong
I'm a problem
That'll never ever be solved
I'm a monster, I'm a maven
I know this world is changing
You'll never take that from me
It's amazin', so amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin' (Let's go)
I'm a monster
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of
Alright alright, alright
Throw your hands in the sky right now

But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Man I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Man I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy

At that moment I dispersed
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of town
Ain't no love cause you ain't around
Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man I tried to stop man I tried the best I could
But (You make me smile)
Every day a star is born
(And you say New York City!)
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey

Hey yo, y'all niggas don't want it

Rappers I've met or dealt with direct
Is it true he won't send a beat tape until he get a check?
What's the position you hold?
Can he really master depths who check by check
And 'H to the IZZO' only single that went gold?
If Roc-a-Fella should fold and you're left out in the cold
Is it back to ghost producin' for D.Dot on the low?
Ugh

How many niggas bit the soul, bout (a million)
How many hoes did I bone, bout (a million)
Uh-uh, uh-uh, it's (a million), uh-uh

[CinoS]
I woke up and looked around
And I don't like what I'm seeing
A lot of pain, a lot of tears
And a lot of people leaving
So I'm wondering, where you at
Why now, why
We need help, come down
But, you never show
People so oppressive they stay for it
Thinking it'll be different so they pray for it
Spend their whole life praising you
I bet they'll suffer in their grave too
Hope flowin' down the steam
It seems that deception is the theme

Kanye West: We the real rockstars and I'm the biggest of all of them. I'm the biggest rock star on the planet.
Zane Lowe: There it is. That record- it says that. That's what your album says when you come out, and there are songs on there where you make it very clear.
KW: So what I want to explain to everybody out there, it's like, I make music I can do it, but I shouldn't be limited to only one place of creativity. And it's literally only like one of two reason why I haven't been able to break that down. 
ZL: But why should you feel that you are? Because- 
KW: No! This is the thing you guys don't understand. You guys don't understand. You guys don't understand that I did the Yeezys and they EBAY'd for 90 thousand dollars and people wanted them bad as whatever, right? But I didn't get a call from Nike the next day. You guys don't understand that I've met with companies and they say, ""What we're trying to figure out is how we can control you and control that"". If you're an architect and you're a world builder and you have all these ideas and you're Gaudi, and you want to build buildings, if you don't ever get that out, what's gonna happen? 
ZL: Isn't that why you do it? Isn't it the process? Isn't it point to do it? 
KW: I don't think you're really hearing what I'm saying. 
Zane Lowe: Grab a seat, grab a seat. So, you remember this place? Graduation? I was also thinking about some of the other things we've done as well with the BBC, like Abbey Road sprung to mind with the strings.
Kanye West: Oh yeah. That was good. That suit was like, I would've worn something different if I could look back right now. I could still do a suit, I just wouldn't have done that exact lapel situation.
ZL: But talk about really putting yourself on the line with that. That was so early on for you to be stepping in a room with that many players and to give yourself that objective. What are your thoughts when you think back about Abbey Road, where...it's just nuts. 
KW: I thought it was good. I thought it was what I was supposed to do at that time. If I see something, if I see an opportunity, I'm gonna go for it. We're all gonna die one day. 
ZL: Yeah, that's true. 
KW: So live like that. Live like you could die tomorrow. Go for it. Those steps have been the platforms that allowed me to make it this far. 
ZL: And you have, man, and you're here. Six original albums of your own, a Throne record, various records with G.O.O.D. Music to talk about. But seriously, man, Yeezus. Bravo, dude. I mean, that is one of the most creative records of any genre I've heard in a very, very long time, and just in terms of your output, your most exciting-sounding record, I think. 
KW: Oh, thank you very much. Yeah, I feel I was able to start making exactly what was in my mind again, not having to speak with the textures of the time. Cause, you know, Cruel Summer is definitely Kanye West, and there's something weird and kind of off about ""Mercy,"" like when it has the high-pitched (impersonates noise), that type of sound. It sounds like art still a little bit, even though it obviously was a radio smash. 
But when I get into the idea, the trap drums and things like that, certain songs that are blatant radio hits, it's like I'm speaking with today's textures. If you look at it 200 years from now, it's not going to stand out in the way that 808s or Yeezus stands out, and can completely push or redefine or make people say, hey, I completely hate that, or I completely love that, but let me just think differently. Because everybody is bound to these -- no pun intended -- they're bound to sixteen bars or eight bars, and the normal radio thing. 
I was talking to Frank Ocean about this, and said, my mom got arrested for the sit-ins, and now we're more like the sit-outs. Like, sit off of radio, and say, hey radio, come to us. We need to find something new, because it's being controlled in a way, and manufactured in a way, that really awesome artists can make amazing music and not break as far past as, like, something that's very formulaic. 
ZL: So it almost feels like a duty to you in a weird way? Having the peoples' ear, having peoples' attention for great music, to be able to say, well, if I'm not challenging them enough, I'm not challenging myself, not challenging radio, what am I doing? 
KW: Yeah. I'm not trying to regurgitate myself. I showed people that I understand how to make perfect. Dark Fantasy could be considered to be perfect. I know how to make perfect. But that's not what I'm here to do. I'm here to crack the pavement and make new grounds, sonically and society, culturally. 
ZL: You've done that with Yeezus. It's fascinating for us to sit here and talk about this record now, because normally when I talk to artists about records of this nature, it's in the lead-up to something. So we're all kind of playing a guessing game, you know what I mean? You could tell me what you think of the record, but I'm trying to find my way around it, the audience probably won't have heard it. In this case, it's been out for a minute, so we can reflect on it with the benefit of hindsight, too. You've seen what everyone else has had to say about this record, both good and bad. But I'm fascinated to know, today, how you would describe Yeezus, as someone who made it. How you would describe that record. 
KW: I just think that I'm a production person, I'm a product guy, I'm a producer. So if I'm working on a John Legend album, I'm gonna try to give John Legend the best home for him to stay in. And I'm gonna try to push Pusha T -- no pun intended once again, this keeps happening to me -- to make the thing that represents what I like about his music the most. And then for me as Kanye West, I gotta fuck shit up. 
ZL: And you did, dude, seriously. From the minute it starts. I mean, seriously. (Plays opening to "" On Sight""). It's disgusting. 
skrrt skrrt
KW: Nah. This is me going to the studio with Thomas and Guy-Manuel, who's Daft Punk. They had a synthesizer the size of that wall right there. This is just one session right here. This beat was originally like 14 minutes long, and that part in the beginning was something we completely just distorted, and I ended up making that the intro. 
ZL: You know, I got a beef with you over this track. It's too short! I wanted more out of it. Cause it's one of the best beats on the record for me, and it feels like you're just getting warmed up. Was that kind of deliberate, to pull back after only a couple of verses and go, you know what, we're going to get on with the album now? 
KW: Nah, it's just what I felt, like it should be. 
ZL: Just a dance thing. 
KW: And you know, originally ""Blood on the Leaves"" was supposed to be first. 
ZL: Wow. 
KW: Which, psychologically, I know would have changed certain Yeezus naysayers about the album. It wasn't that time for me. I didn't want to come up there and perform. A lot of times, music can be presented as a service position. But I wanted to take a more aggressive approach with music. 
You know, people go on a vacation and say, you got the drugs, you got the music, you got the wine? It's in that territory. But I wanted to speak up and say, okay, so my voice is only compressed to express myself artistically through music. It's the only place where I actually have a deal, so I can only consistently make things in music. So I'm gonna take music and I'm gonna try to make it three-dimensional, like on Star Wars and the hologram'll pop up out of R2D2. I'm gonna try to make something that jumps up and affects you, in a good or bad way. Whether it's, I'm going into a scream in the middle of the track because that's just the way I feel. But I'm not here to make easy listening, easy programmable music.

Or DC, PG, or ATL
Back in Chi, I mean my life like a magazine
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Father penthouse, yeah that's upscale
Mademoiselle got a hell of a black tail
I'm feelin' the vibe, her body and soul
skrrt skrrt
Well let's kill all the pollyin', I offer you a Cosmopolitan
Let's jet out the club, get some oxygen
Your friends say I'm a player, you'd be lucky to keep me
You know people gon' be talkin' 'bout us weekly
My car be in a robbery
P-O-R-T but what's more important to me is that
Don't be comin' 'round my girl tryna act like Mr. Friendly
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
And for them fake boobies, I paid them Benjis
Get your own
I got Paris, he got Nicky, he tried to get him a clone
He said, ""Ye, you know you got extra hoes
And everything you do is extra cold""
skrrt skrrt
I got family in high places like Jesus niece
Can I please say my peace?
If y'all fresh to death then I'm deceased
And this one here is a heat rock, spit like a beatbox
The way the beat rocks, new version of Pete Rock
But for that Benz I get CL love
So I switched my girls around like 3L dub
skrrt skrrt
My freak girl told me now she's a Christian
skrrt skrrt
I'm pullin' girls off the bench like a 6th man
I'm in the club pullin' the same old two step
While Omegas doin' the same old Q step
I had my money on my mind, I was thinkin' green
She a pledge, AKA, she was pink and green
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I wasn't really spittin' game, I was scrimmagin'
My penmanship is so hard it needs censorship
I'm a Chicago win 'til Chicago wins
'Til we blow like Chicago wind
I don't know what's better, gettin' laid or gettin' paid
I just know when I'm gettin' one the other's gettin' away
I have to say, we goin' to mass today
We have to pray, these niggas is wack and aye I have to say
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
First of all, let's get rid of them Louis Vuitton boots
skrrt skrrt
Planes, trains, automobiles
The G500s with the auto-roll wheels
Pinot Grigio, got 'em on chill
See now, see me ho? I got that deal
If you tryna build, I bet you'd like to know that
My father was a Black Panther with Geronimo Pratt
And back in college, I ain't run with no frat
I just ran with the track that put the Chi on the map
Now the Roc in the buildin', UIC Pavilion
Two years ago I was just a civilian
Now every chick in here swear I got millions
skrrt skrrt
Hold up, I'm fuckin' up the rap
Every chick in here swear I got millions
skrrt skrrt
Yo it's the Lake Shore Drive
Keep it live, tight, raw
You better hurry up, they can't keep it in the store
To be the format, your whole style on one beat
Insert the disk, watch a nigga press delete
Tryna flex your technique
You gettin' blasted with a TEC, that shit is mad ironic
Like Alanis Morisette, you try but can't jet
Bunch of airline lyrics, rhymes for low fare
Flyin' out of O'Hare
While these no-name ass niggas wanna go there, nobodies
Livin' three blocks from nowhere, down the street from nothin'
Let me show these niggas somethin', visual aid, the page
And the nigga who fronted, word to God, they don't want it
But they wanna play the role, actin' hardcore
Watch the whole career, flow, my style is too cold
Always, forever like Luther, but it ain't original
Because I stole it from the future, now I'm wanted in three centuries
The verbal killin', ask me where I got the style

Yo, what would make a scared man pull a trigga'?
The same thing that make a scared man act bigga'
The same thing that make me grab my tec and empty quicker
Adrenaline rush, on the hush
You will die fuckin' wit' us
Vacant lot is my home and In my team I trust
So don't talk about them things if yo' things don't bust
I knew a guy like you, his name was Filipe
Had me on 3-way with the D.A
Tryin' to find out where we stay
So on my 24th b-day I'm locked up in V.A
He don't know my guns turn commotion to slow motion
Then from slow motion to no motion
Run up in the place he hip hoppin'
Spit shots in, clip droppin', if I get caught, get Cochran
And give Pedro my pesos so he don't snitch while I lay low
For 'bout a week or two
Come back like peek-a-boo, you see me, I see you
And if you talk, you be in ICU
[Cardan]
Yo, yo, this Cardan

Like I know a hundred brotha's that's real
But I think it's time you know how we chill

Industry super heavyweights such as JAY Z, Beyonce, Kanye West, Coldplay, Rihanna, Madonna, and Calvin Harris have all turned their profile blue to support streaming service Tidal, which JAY Z recently purchased. The service launches March 30, 2015.
The artists are performing a ‘Coup d'état' style campaign to overthrow Spotify, on the eve of its rumoured $16B acquisition.
Mashable.com writes:
Earlier this year, Jay Z bought Aspiro, a Swedish tech company that runs two streaming music services (WiMP and Tidal) for $56 million. Monday's announcement will finally reveal what the 45-year-old rap mogul will do with his purchase.
Tidal's website describes the service as such: ""Introducing the first music streaming service that combines the best High Fidelity sound quality, High Definition music videos and expertly Curated Editorial.""
Consequenceofsound.com writes:
A new high-fidelity streaming music service helmed by Jay Z launches Monday. TIDAL was acquired by the rapper last month as part of a $56 million dollar deal with the Scandinavian platform Aspiro.
Full details of the service will be announced during a press conference on Monday. However, according to TIDAL's website, it's “the first music streaming service that combines the best High Fidelity sound quality, High Definition music videos and expertly Curated Editorial.”
There are two paid subscription options: $19.99 a month for high-fidelity audio, and $9.99 for standard quality audio. TIDAL can be streamed on the web, and downloaded for iOS and Android devices.
Several artists have already thrown their support behind TIDAL, changing their Twitter icons to light blue and tweeting the hashtag #TIDALForAll. Among them were Kanye West and Jack White's Third Man Records
TIDAL joins the ranks of an already crowded streaming music market, which includes Spotify, Rdio, Amazon, Pandora, and Neil Young's high-fidelity PONO digital store. Additionally, Apple is said to be developing its own service with the assistance of Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor.
USA Today writes:
Music mogul Jay Z is expected on Monday to unveil his blueprint for high-resolution music streaming service Tidal.

You the best bride and I'm the best groom
Wedding presents got my best man at the Best Buy
Buyin' the Best of Fresh Prince for the bedroom
I'mma buy a summer house, with a rec room
And a car with no backseat and some leg room
And some strawberries and some chocolate
And a fridge and some broccoli
Cause I know you like vegetables even though I don't
I won't say I won't eat it if you chef it
Fuck it I'll hire Geoffrey to get a beverage if you should ever get parched
You feel like Ruby Dee to me, great and powerful Ossie
Who's behind the man behind the curtain? Foxy
Coffee brown as the bosom I flew in on
Nose round like the wheels that my rims spin on
Lips full like the light on the dash was flickin'
Oh wait it wasn't
Oh and I forgot I'll take a microwaver oven

skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
You made me the way I am today
You're the reason why
I live how I live
Cuz you made me the way I am
First of all, I was the worst of all
The first born, took my first breath, it was on
And thanks to my moms, and some help from Nickie Bonds
I was raised in ways of a Don
They gas me like Exxon
Had me dealin' with ex cons, frontin' with they Rolex on
Get sexed on a regular basis, grown women puttin' they faces
In all the wrong places, molesting me, now you see why my destiny
Was fucked up cuz my recipe
But I blame my mother cuz I can't blame no other
And that's how my game was discovered
My mom was a sucker, did that bullshit to my brother
But no matter what, I'mma love her
She gave me life, even though she got high undercover
If she die, I can't find me another
But look what you made me
Yeah, you made me this way, since the day I was born
When you slid on that crack shit, mom be strong
'Fore long, I realized the same old song
Another cat that done bounced on his kid and his spouse
At the beginning, I knew my pops just had to be kidding
He's coming back any day, he wouldn't leave us that way
Man, this might be the end of anticipation
Waitin', drivin' makes me turn it first
Like, I don't make a statement
Things and rappers nowadays
They're terrible
It's what I say
I think I gotta show a fist for nothing less than blowin' bling
[Bridge - I'm A Droppa]
3, 2...2...now
Watch me go to work in these gallows I never seen 'em before
They laughing now, I used to go ""No!""
I was spitting for how it is and I don't care about this shit
Bang I go on a homie, light a blunt
Bad rappers finna get on it, I don't give the whip
I'm the sickest, coming with it on, peep it
You don't understand
Fuckin' step to me and my altar and don't give me another chance
I'm a boss, I'm an animal by nature
Fucking proud of my check, yee, you know I got the banga
I take rope and I floss these haters
Murder every single person screaming peace
I ain't pregnant cuz honestly homie that's a bit foamy and
[Pre-Hook - I'm A Droppa]
Ha! My problem on the track
What you gonna do about that?
White rappers, step back
I'm the gorilla, silverback, yeaaah
Boy!
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Uh, you know you know how the story goes
You done jocked my style, you done stole my flow
You done seen me out, you gets no hello
And you wonder why? Man you know you know
Yeah and you should let them boys know too
Show them niggas every single thing I showed you
I'm here feeling like 50 back in '02, and everybody sayin' I'm the man, so true
Yeah but what does it take to feel secure?
A place with wooden floors and space to put awards
A couple of parking spots and maids to do the chores
The cars you always wanted, the women that you adore
Well I got it, I got it
I wonder if I'd be happy without it, I doubt it
I try not to really think about it
I made it but I'm still playin' like I'm bein' scouted til I'm out it
Game time bitch, I hope you're proud of us
King James shit watch me throw the powder up
This OG got my whole suite cloudin' up
And I bet you I be out of time before I'm out of luck
They ain't rootin' for me, they ain't clappin' for me
I'm only sayin can somebody just be happy for me
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Uhh, please make your long story shorter
Cause time is of the essence for the king of first quarter
Numbers do the talkin' I have nothing for reporters

Take notice of what's in front of you

And you'll never know how good it feels to have all of my affection
And you'll never get a chance to experience my lovin'

[En?gma: Yoshimitsu]
Eh ehi, lo specchio parla
Sarà che non c'è volta ch'io non dorma senz'alba
Sarà che questa luce ti mette i pensieri in gabbia
O il fatto che m'aspiro rimorsi, rimpianti e rabbia
Sbaglia, chi si sottomette al proprio vizio
Basta raggirarlo tipo arte del Ninjitsu
Ok, se medito mi ricarico
è che se sparisco, mi ferisco e m'infilzo..Yoshimitsu!
Fisso il vuoto tra generazioni, si
Non si fuma più guardando le costellazioni qui
Ora il tempo corre e trama scismi, finti divismi
Mentre chi col globo invece fa il Monopoli
Vedi, in città l'affanno assume varie forme
Teatralità ed inganno tipo ""Setta delle Ombre""
Tu tira pure le tue somme hombre
Ma chi fa i live come noi, ""No one on the corner""
Yo Fag
You look like a dirty rag
You filthy slag
UNLOAD MY MAG
Then put in back in my bag
Bitch i have to wag
Just so i dont see you
Bape Bapesta ""Dropout Bear""
If you ever see somebody next to me, know that they're better than me at something
So -- bars. Bars
So it's really good to have this event tonight which we decided instantaneously, the way we put this shit together, y'all comin' out here tonight vibin' with us. In the way this whole albums put together. The amount of producers that came together for it and the way we worked on this shit really collectively, collaboratively. We didn't give a fuck about what nobody else said outside lookin' in, anything. We just wanted to make the best product possible. And this is just the beginning of an entirely new mentality of how to make music directed for the people. What I said last night is like, we drop this shit June 18th. This ain't about waitin' until August and havin' some big this and that. It's about deliverin' some shit for y'all to go to work to, ride to, listen to while y'all workin' out and shit. Whatever y'all doin' to provide a soundtrack for this shit that's gon' come out. We gon' keep on doin' this shit over and over and over. Makin' shit for my core, my cut
Statement from ESPO:
""At the time I made the painting I had only seen the SNL performance and that was convincing enough. I read Jon Caramanica's article in the NY Times and took Yeezus's answers as the yospel truth.""
Here is the piece in full: Close-ups: ""Respect my marketing abilities"" ""I hit every one of my shots, I deserve to be on this team""
""I want to break glass ceilings""

I'm building up buzz
I noticed she smelled the fragrance
Money is a bitch
Time is money
And it seems that Time is wasting
But shout out to that bitch
Cause I'll probably never chase her
Staring at a bully
Hoping that he never takes her
But only time will tell

Been around hoes that fucked Biggie and Pac
Like Vida Guerra
Ass took her to the top
She'll give you some brains
You let her throw up the Roc
Let her put on your chain, she'll throw you some cock
Picture that, like Megan Good and Jamie Foxx
Hype said ""It's a wrap,"" she still on the set
Puttin' oil on her legs, like she Gloria Velez
She was eye candy in the Double X-L
Hopped off the page and on the skateboard with Pharrell
I knew she (wouldn't get far)
'Cause five hundred dollars can't get you that (far)
How you get that (far)?
And all these new video bitches tryin' be Melyssa Ford
But they don't know Melyssa Ford drive a Honda Accord
She a video vixen, but behind close doors
She do whatever it take to get to the Grammy Awards
Ha ha

Not to brag, but, if it add up, one, two
Nigga, that's mad nuts
Game, you mad nuts
How you gonna call out all these
Bitches knowin' damn well they gonna call me?
The only dream of the ghetto prom queen
Was to make it to the screen, maybe get seen
Maybe get chose by a nigga from a team
Head so good, he don't ask for a prenup'
Now ask your self this question, uh
Would you be with Jay-Z if he wasn't C-E-O?
Would you be with F-A-B-O if he drove an E-O?
Would you ride with Ne-Yo if he was in a Geo?
Well, why the hell you think these bitches comin' at me for?
But since they all fall in my palm, I'll take a trio

The most critically acclaimed wordsmith in the game
I give you words, spit with flames
Stay to myself and let nerves mix with lames
Connoisseur of Kama Sutra, do somethin' absurd with your dame
I used to love this girl who loved shoppin' and smokin' herb
But my job was to hustle dro
Now an artist of the spoken word, I just hustle flow

It may seem I'm sitting on a fortune
But sometimes money isn't so important
In my hood, I'm equivalent to Jordan
Dribbling on the court, but shawty I'm just recording
Fuck tricking, rather give it to an orphan
All you wanna do it hit the clit until it's sore, then
Get her pregnant, then neglect it
Then you go and tell the chick ""get an abortion""
Them type of niggas Cyhi is not endorsing
They sitting down to take a leak, I'm pissing on the porcelain..
I'm from the South, but my parents are New Yorkin
Shouts out to Albany - I see you Uncle Norman!
Keep your family before friends
Cause God is the only one that come before them
You got a nephew? Well, go support him!
You got some nieces, make sure that you adore them
I miss mine, cause I'm always out here touring
Or with the strippers at the Hilton up on Cortland
One from Utah, the other one from Portland
Throwin' on the Calliope, but I ain't from New Orleans
I can't lie, I lust for things
Like an old-school 'Lac or a Cut supreme
Or an iced-out G shock and a custom ring
And the freak with an ass that sits above her jeans
skrrt skrrt
Shawty stay caked up
skrrt skrrt
Just bought an Escalade truck
skrrt skrrt
You put some 26s on it
skrrt skrrt
Yo shit be looking pretty, don't it?
skrrt skrrt
You hit the club and make it rain
skrrt skrrt
You spend like 50 on the chain
But every 365 bro, you get a little wiser
And realize all that stupid shit bought was lame
Cause it don't mean shit, when you out there on your own
Cause it don't mean shit, when the Feds run in your home
Cause it don't mean shit, when you can't take care of your kids
Cause it don't mean shit, nigga, fuck what ya did
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Why do I feel so alone?... Okay I'm really not alone
But it just feels like I'm alone, it's like I really don't belong
My insecurities is here, so I'm not really on my own
Blowing 50k a year, for a Morehouse that's not a home
I don't really like the vibe here, feels like I gotta hide here
Been up here for 2 years, I can truly say I tried here
Emotionally, mentally, spiritually tired here
I honestly don't even think niggas would care if I died here
And I'm just tryna find my place
But the only girl I trust is like a million miles away
Okay only really like 200 but that's besides the case
I'm just hoping the distance don't cause that love to fade away
And I wanna talk to God but we ain't talked in so long
Probably looking down ashamed cause I ain't singing His songs
My mama probably wonder where she went wrong
But it's on me cause if I fail, I wanna do it on my own
And you ever hear this song, I apologize to you
I'm sorry for never telling you that what I be going through
Got enough on ya own plate , so if you take my portion too
Be like 19 years ago when you was eating for two
For 9 months you carried me, hoping you'd never bury me
Yeah I know that thought was scary, you're hoping one day I marry
But I saw what happened to y'all's, that ain't the move
Cause you gave your all to him and look what he did to you
skrrt skrrt

(Uh-huh honey)
Baller from Perry Hall
If the first date ain't great, won't call
No pressure
On the bright side won't second guess her
Bag full of condoms in the dresser
I got high standards so they ain't getting lesser
Had a girl last year but I left her
Now I'm on the re-search like professor
Find a candidate then I test her
She the one for me, or she sneeze, God bless her

Ain't nobody real in this world except Messiah
The God that I serve
Seems like everywhere that I go
Everybody got they hands out, the body is divided
One sided defining the signs as the prodigal
We all gettin' money, vamanos
Head in the clouds, chase the rain to the pot of gold
Hot or cold, audible to the Father, in His hands holds eternity possible
Reverent Apostle, the Doctor, miracle defying when His blood applied to the obstacle
Unbreakable, never shaken the faith of the King unstoppable
And that's real to me, now what's real to you
At times what's real to us, might be real untrue
I find faith in what made the last name Absolute
The homies found it in a money making avenue
Where you can cradle the fence sit on the bench and be luke warm
Shout hallelujah, dab it up, put some fly suits on
Then you all set, bet, if you ain't on yet
Put up some bread and you can sit with the best of the best
A Rap, (God)zilla, like you got success cause your blessed
Never speak about Messiah and these sheep are impressed
Listen up, I could do it just like you
Compromise truth and live just like you
Get drunk, smoke blunts, and fuss just like you
But that's not somethin' I could see God do
In your face they unashamed but claim you changed and you ain't brothers
Never been a lame not entertained with the pedigree of a buster
Truth remains keep it like bread and the bread is buttered
I suffered being subtle know I wrap dum candy circles ‘round these suckas
Cut the tape, what a brutally honest picture that I paint and let it suffocate
My brush accustomed, using the mud as ink
Corrupt seduction of using a front and bluffing, while the blood of saints
Is ushered into discussion I smell the second coming, Yet we run astray
Chasing after after what is disgusting, concussed from the deduction
Of what is Holy and covered the Ark of the covenant encompassed
Made public and unencumbered by the Father when He sent His Son away
Where can we run today (AYE)
I ain't gon' lie
I almost cry
When I think about the Life that I cost

Why we ain't real with each other (yeah)

Don't let nobody tell you what you can do, what you can believe, what you can achieve. Don't let nobody but you
You know, people be looking at me like I got a problem or something. Like I'm uncontrollable or something. Like I don't do what I'm supposed to do. You know it's like they want to have everybody so brainwashed. They want to control everybody, you know, rumors, lies, media, marketing. It's like they want to steal you from you, and sell you back to you after they stole it. They want to make you feel like you less than who you really are
Cuz as far as I'm concerned everybody's a star. See they want to make you feel like you less than you really are. Cuz as far as I'm concerned everybody's a star 
You know, uh, the first thing they do is crush your dreams. Crush your dreams. Then add a couple drops of low self-esteem. And then I don't think everything is what it seems. And control you with lies. And control you with lies 
You know Imma tell you something, first thing they do is crush your dreams. Then let's add a couple, a couple of drops of low esteem. And they control you with lies. And they control you with lies. And they control you with lies. We goin' out of control tonight. We goin' out of control tonight. Ahh 
How many people tonight with a show of hands think they are fucking awesome? [Crowd cheers] 
Now with a show of hands: How many people tonight have had people tell you your whole life that you wasn't fucking awesome? [Crowd cheers] 
See this is what I'm talking about.This is what I'm talking about. This is what I'm talking about. I mean, this is what I'm talking about, this is what I'm talking about 
How many people tonight have ever talked to somebody right, that you know they'll say, I don't know what's wrong with Kanye or make it seem like I'm a bad person in some way, right? Now what have I ever done that was so wrong other than believe in myself? Now believing in yourself is so, so, so wrong that the other side is so, so, so, so strong, they're trying to beat down and demonize and dishumanize — I don't know if that's a word or not, but it's now a word, cuz I said it's a fucking word — and try to dishumanize people who believe in themselves. Cuz then what happens? Then you believe in yourself. And then you believe in yourself and you believe anything is possible. How many people believe that what they dream about, what y'all want to do, whether you want to be a doctor or lawyer, a designer, a musician, video-game programmer, a lighting guy, a manager … how many people want to contribute something to the world?

Untamed youths, the Coupes moves like bullets

Made it a young nigga destiny to do the exact same
Young wyling and all, me and my Codys
Watch the phonies, and hoes that claim they blew me
Dark skin China doll with the fake tits
Ice grillin' my Spanish chick, word
We all in together, now we off it

Fuck 'em, I would never sweat for a piggy

Headed home I'm bout to slam dunk
Pray to the box of mags, protect me when I'm old

And expect me to be humble

Picture if you will that the throne's burning 
Rome's burning and I'm sitting in the corner all alone burning 
Why does it always end up like this? 
Something that we don't determine 
Same people that I fought for, that I fight for, that I ride for 
That I live for, that I die for 
Be the reason that these niggas is alive for 
And they want me dead but I'm so sorry but I just can't die for you 
But I can make 'em put their hands in the sky for you 
We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th 
Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for? 
When the grief is over, beef is over 
I'll be fly when Easter's over 
I tried to teach niggas how to be kings 
And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers 
So the love is gone 'til blood is drawn 
So we no longer wear the same uniform 
Fuck you squares, the circle got smaller 
The castle got bigger, the walls got taller 
And truth be told after all that said 
Niggas still got love for you

My life this year my career is the lore
Bad shit is a war is for Melissa ford
'94 I could only afford this accord
From the home of gang bangin and we all outdoors
Southside outside westside lets ride eastside right beside lakeshore drive
And i'm (and i'm) chi towns finest, where you at the whole city behind us
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Southside outside westside lets ride
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I came here to shut the place down
Till my body starts pumpin red fluid
A-town I been through it
And we steady getting tested
But ready to feel your bubble
When we put the lead to it
Out west they still bangin
Up top it's really gulley
Down south we get buck and turn hearts to silly putty
Ludacris I got silly money you got jokes
I'll be laughing all the way to the bank now that's really funny
Big city bright lights, and many pity cause we like fights
Maybe long days but its fight nights
Living out the night life
Us living as we do upside down. 
And the new word to have is revolution. 
People don't even want to hear the preacher 
spill or spiel because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued. 
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey. 
The youngsters who were programmed to continue 
fucking up woke up one night digging 
Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys. 
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes. 
The signs of Truth were tattooed across our open ended vagina. 
We learned to our amazement untold tale of scandal. 
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault, 
hosed down daily with a gagging perfume.

Red, white, blue, I pledge allegence to the street life
Even if it's leftovers I still got to eat right
Got gas in my peace pipe, pink Sprite
She P-popping her jeans tight, all day I dream about sex, three stripes
This is something like the Holocaust, millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord 'til I die I'm-a fucking ball
Now who gon stop me? Who gon stop me huh?
Who gon stop me? Who gon stop me, huh?
(Black cards, black cars, black on black, black broads

You just a commentator if you getting paper
Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
In some relations you're just supposed to say none
Heard she fucked the doorman
Well that’s cool I fucked the waitress
Heard Yeezy was racist, well, I guess that’s on one basis
I only like green faces
Y'all weed purple, my money purple
Y'all Steve Urkel, I’m Oprah's circle

[Infamous Syndicate]
Look, if you don't trust me why the fuck is you with me?
Coming at me on some Jay Z shit, who you with?
Calling my cell, leaving crazy voicemails
Figured you can get me if you called my girl Nikki
But she was with me and I was home at seven fifty
But that was when he got technical with it
Talkin 'bout he called my house at seven fifty nine
I don't keep up with the time, what the fuck you think I'm lyin'?
It all comes down to you trust me or you won't
The bottom line is you love me or you don't
And do you need me baby?
Yeah you know I do
So you believe me baby?
Yeah for sure I do
Then he gave me a hug, jumped in the trunk and went to work
He managed to leave without getting his feelings hurt
So I sat back, flamed up the weed and thought up
Who the hell done run their mouth and almost got me caught up
skrrt skrrt
He said (""But I don't usually"")

He said (""You know I don't usually"")
skrrt skrrt
I be hatin' when you actin' brand new to me
Look you can't be tellin' people that you doin me
You gotta keep this here between you and me
Look, I feel bad about the fact that you gotta creep with me
When your man be around, you don't speak to me
When my girl be around, I see you peepin' me
When they both ain't around, you be freakin' me
We used to do it secretly, now you all talk
You tellin' everybody like you wanna get caught
I think my girl catchin' on cause my story keep changin' up
You gotta stop callin' up my crib and hangin' up
Truthfully, if you tellin' people that you doin' me
Then you tellin' me that you don't even wanna screw with me
And that's a shame, I can't even do my thing
skrrt skrrt
What we talking bout? Real shit or we talking 'bout rhymes?
You talking 'bout millions or you talking 'bout mine?
What we talking 'bout, cause I ain't got time
For what people be talking 'bout all the time
What we talking 'bout fiction or we talking 'bout fact?
You talking 'bout fiction? Hold up, pardon my back
I'm talking 'bout life and all I hear is:
""Oh yeah he keeps talking 'bout crack""
I ain't talking 'bout profit, I'm talking 'bout pain
I'm talking 'bout despair, I'm talking 'bout shame

What is you talking 'bout? I don't know what y'all sayin'
People keep talking 'bout ""Hov take it back""
I'm doin' better than before, why would I do that?
Ain't nothing cool about carrying a strap
Bout worrying your moms and burying your best cat
Talking 'bout revenge while carrying his casket
All teary-eyed, bout to take it to a mattress
I'm talking 'bout music, I ain't talking 'bout rap
You talking 'bout who's hot - I ain't talking 'bout that
The conversation is changed, let's yap about that
I don't run rap no more, I run the map
They talk, we live, we see what they say
They talk, We did, who cares what they say
Still they can't' focus on them, they be talking 'bout me
Talking 'bout what I wear, talking 'bout where I be
Check out my hair: these ain't curls these is peas

Low self-esteem, hide it in Lean (Yeah), Xan every meal

Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well, uh
Black Axl Rose, move halfs and wholes
Come down to the jungle, just ask for Hov
Move blocks and squares, move apples and pears
Work pots and pans, just to cop me some Airs
My uncle died, my daddy did too
Paralyzed by the pain, I can barely move
My nephew gone, my heart is torn
Sometimes I look to the sky, ask why I was born
My faith in God, every day is hard
Every night is worse, that's why I pray so hard
Why I pray so hard, this is crazy God
Just when I thought I had everything, I lost it all
So que sera, get a case of Syrah
Let it chase the pain, before it goes too far

Harlem back be alright, Fo' Reel be alright, Ma$e is back be alright
skrrt skrrt
Ma$e said c'mon, Mike said chamone
Started up early like Raven-Symoné
Keisha Knight-Pull, Emmanuel
I dropped out of school with no manual
Nothin' handed to dude but did I complain
Every time magazines try to taint my name
But ya'll can't hold me down like restraint
I took the T off out the word can't
'round same time when Nas said I can
Bush for sendin' our fam to Iran
I'm in the club with a henny ass in my other hand
Lord please forgive me, I'm just a man
Right now I'm trying to make some adjustments
Before they do me like they did Janet and Just' and 'em
Me and my cuz and them
Trying to rap like bust and them
And my clothes was busted and bummy
But I ain't eva, eva, accept no money from these so called sponsors
They was in Benzes, I was in Hondas
Now I wonder where they all at like Ananda
Hmm... yea... that something to ponder
The money I make on this one's for Donda
That's West to you, you the next
I can't hold my breath for you
What you need to do is turn it up some decibels
And put some more zeroes in front of that decimal, nigga
skrrt skrrt
I'm gonna have a sweet life, sweetest life you've ever seen
And when the day is over, gonna go to sleep and I feel the greed
Momma can you hear me?
I'm pushin a Cadillac man, it's black man
And I'm a black man, in a Cadillac man, see what I'm saying is?
Ain't no diamonds in the back, diamonds on my neck
D-Diamonds on my neck, D-Diamonds on my neck
I'm so fresh, so clean, edge sharper than a ginsu
Look at the soul of my Air 1's, see what I been through
Been through the struggle and drove through the fire
Kanye on the track, that nigga spittin' through the wire
I spit that pain rap, every chorus need a choir
Like feinds need suppliers, like Daytons to the wires
I'm rollin', rollin'
Turn my music up and keep rollin', rollin'..
skrrt skrrt
Turn the music up, we just rollin', rollin'
Let the windows down and keep rollin', rollin'
skrrt skrrt
Picture me rollin', rollin'
System on blast, just rollin', rollin'
Foot on the gas, we just rollin', rollin'
skrrt skrrt
I got my back on the wall like a hustler
Smokin' like a muffler, waiting for the customers
I got that that weight, that they push up state for
Feinds can't wait for, enemies hate for
Me to make that cake or drive through the state for
P-H-X, A-Z is what I came for
Rock my chain for, hooked up with Game for

Come sweetly, stab me through the shadow of an open door
Wait quietly now, take us to the helplessness of it all
And I wonder as I watch you slip away somehow
Wonder if the only thing left is love
Wonder if I ever will wait
skrrt skrrt

Oh, lie to me
Lie to me, tell me I'm not wasting time
skrrt skrrt
Oh, oh, convince me you miss me
Your heart still beats as fast as mine
Tell me lies
Hip hop, uh
When I fight and you fight, we don't fight fair
So I guess I'll see you in my nightmares
Just remember I made you like my Nike Air
Ye-Yeezys, please be easy
To kill the animosity that's in the air
I'll touch every curve of your body like a Herve Leger
And this wasn't no ordinary love
Our sex wasn't ordinary drugs
It's that crack, that crystal meth
I mean it gets so wet, I had to go in depth
I mean the bitch so fresh I had to go in debt
Ru-running my credit card 'til there's no more left
Uh but that's cool, you wife and I'll be groom
I thought I had a sign a Seal like Heidi Klum
Like Jay and B
Like Chris and Ri
But this Christmas you'll be missing me
He walks outside for a cigarette break
And thinks how many cigarettes does it take
He takes a long drag with the sun in his eye
He squints, he thinks, he starts to sigh
Sometimes he cry
When he thinks about his girlfriend on his side
She held him down
She made him better
Fought for love, you fucked up weather

You claim you got hoes, nigga we can't tell
You claim you got dough, but we can't tell
You bought one pair of 1s at a two-for-one sale
Politics kept me at the end of the mixtapes
So I dropped my own get-well-soon-from-sick tape 
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
So niggas' money is homo, it's hard to get straight 
I'm trying to do numbers like Pac did
But it ain't Shakur, it's the brand new Roc kid 
Niggas wanna get me like they got Big
Cause I moved up out the city and got big 
That's the poison, that runs through their veins and attack their soul and just start to tear em up 
Niggas talk so much shit about me in barbershops they forget to get their hair cut
Ok fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
Cause they want gun talk, and I don't go there enough 
But don't get it fucked up, you can still get your head bust
I'm making way too much dough to be playing 
And this is a classic in the making, history repeats itself 
He do the rhymes and the beats himself
The only-child syndrome, make hits on his own
And I'mma look in the mirror if I need some help

Will I stand or will I fall?

Turn a blind eye
Try to pretend that nothing is what it seems
Torn between the impulse to stay
Or running away from all this madness
Who am I to decide what should be done
If this is the end, then let it come
Let it come, let it rain, rain all over me
Like the tide, let it flow

You couldn't be dope for even half a day 
We keep it hot like its after May 
Smoke a nigga then I pass to K 
skrrt skrrt
The pastor say we goin' to mass today 
We have to pray, these niggas is wack 'n' eh 
I have to say, since Pac passed away 
Most these niggas don't even deserve a track from me 
First of all let's get rid of them Louis Vuitton boots 
And get yo tall ass out that C Class coupe 
Y'see the whiskAY had them girls feelin' friskAY 
You was wit mAY (me) she said ""Who's the sissAY?"" 
And even if they did wanna get bizzAY 
Freaky like MissAY and roll the weed up 
You would roll three blunts and fuck up three blunts 
Motherfucka you a fuck up of free lunch, dawg 
Just keep it right thurr like ChingAY 
Yo girl don't like me how long has shee been gAY 
Spanish girls tell ya ""No hable ingle"" 
And everbody wanna run to me for they singlAY (single) 
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help 
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself 
Dawg, if I was you I wouldn't feel myself 
Dawg, if I was you I'd kill myself

Cuz number one, duke is drivin' in the motherfuckin' projects
With a - with a Sebring, and with - with a rag off
Y'na'mean? Y-you not ballin' like that play-boy
Straight up, then the bitch you got playin' shotgun

Really really good, I mean and you gotta shirt and tie

Wack niggas...I don't even like to be around 'em

I'd rather just let the music speak for itself. You know, it's like, I was happy to be in a situation where people couldn't say, oh, I was trying to promote my own song. For the times that I've, like, defended myself...
I'm pushing the envelope! I wrote my fuckin' 'Run This Town' verse for a fuckin' month! When I heard Eminem's verse on the Drake shit, I went back and rewrote my shit for two days. I canceled appointments to rewrite! I fuckin' care! You know what I'm saying? And that's what I'm saying. Because I did that, Taylor Swift cannot win over Beyoncé! Because I wrote my verse in two days, Taylor Swift cannot beat Beyoncé. As long as I'm alive! And if I'm alive, kill me then! Kill me then! As long as I'm alive, you gon' have to deal with it. Cause there ain't gonna be no more motherfucking Elvises with no James Browns

Paparazzo: Hey, Kanye, are you mad at Jim Kimmel? Got anything to say about Jim Kimmel, Kanye? Do you think he was too much with you?
Kanye: Yo, did you just..?
Paparazzo: Are you mad at Jim Kimmel? 
[A little later…] 
Paparazzo: How's it going, Kanye? 
Kanye: Don't say anything to me, man. Like, stop asking me questions. You out in front of my house at 4 AM, talking about, ‘How's it going?” It's not going good, y'all here trying to take money--to take make money off of it. That's how it's going. It's 4 AM and you asking me how it's going. You know I don't want you to say nothing to me. You hear what I'm saying? 
Respect that 
[Kanye lunges for camera] 
Paparazzo: Relax, man 
Kanye: What you mean, “relax?!” 
I don't know if y'all know this one thing about me, but I ain't no motherfucking celebrity. I don't know if y'all know this one thing about me, but I'm a terrible, terrible, terrible celebrity. I don't know if you know this one thing about me, but I'm the worst kind, the worst kind, the worst kind of celebrity. Because all I do is make real music. All I do is sit in the studio and make real, real shit. And that's it. That's motherfucking it, that's motherfucking it
So I don't want nobody coming up to me with no cameras trying to like, sell pictures and shit to magazines. Asking me no dumbass questions. Throwing me off of my focus and shit. Harassing you all mothafucking day. I ain't no motherfucking celebrity. No, no, no, no it's not me. It's too much goddamn you. Lower, lower. Octave under
Y'all take the pianos an octave down. Yo, take away the ""ha, ha, ha."" No ""ha, ha, ha."" Take that shit

Fottono con chi ha la carne sopra alla brace
La musica la ascolti poi dici non ti piace
Quante cazzate chi sa la verità tace
Se mi dicono fotti con me rispondo vai bwoy
Esci e spacchi con gli amici ma non son tuoi
Io di notte o di giorno predico la mia via
E se tu mi vorrai morto bene che cosi sia
Tu vuoi fare l'artista ma non sai quanto costa
Credi che sia solo fotografa, filtra e posta

Bought a big house and a whole lot of rangers
A fresh new couch and a whole lot of trainers
A closet full of clothes and some brand new dangers

Some Mexican floral arrangers
A great big TV that'll entertain us
Some colorful commissions for some high paid painters
Someone to take the rap so that I stay stainless - and
A new relationship with a banker
Two pinky rings for my manicured fingers
A trained German Shepard that bark when it's angered
To watch my possessions and look out for strangers

Ich liebe meine Hood
Komm' vom Urlaub aus Jamaika heim und Leute salutier'n in meiner Hood, killa
Du fährst im Volkswagen, Kid
Ich bin colttragender Pimp mit Hoes in goldfarbenden Strings
Ich bin viel zu bescheiden
Kuck' uns an, wir sind deutsche Rapper, aber trotzdem stilvoll gekleidet
Nigga, sei leise, du bist eine Schande für Rap, ich bin Boss an dem Mic
Sieh dir bitte meine Versace-Watch an und sag, du kannst dir nie sowas leisten
Ich bin Zuhälterrapper wie Juelz Santana
Hab' ich nichts zu tun, mach' ich paar Groupies im Benz klar
Und this mo'fucking hoes and bitches
Sprechen von Hochgenüssen, wenn sie meinen Hoden küssen
Ich stepp' in der Nacht in dein Viertel und töte dich mit Pistolenschüssen

It's a shame how I rap so bananas
It's Mr. Two-Gun Un
Mother fuckers better cock back them hammers
You might catch in the drop blowin pop wit Santana
The hawk on me's not from Atlanta
It's just the father to the Glocks in the hamper
Look in the rear view the cops in the camera
I flow hot like blocks down in Tampa
And leave you dead pop shot from them glammers
And go down south and rock wit them bamas
And come back in the Porsche color hot banana
Vanilla coat seats piper made by Tropicana
Speakers do the wop rims do the Macerana

Father
This prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough This prayer's for everybody that feels they're too messed up
For everyone that feels they've said ""I'm sorry"" too many times
Let them know that's why you took the nail
So we could have eternal life
If all God's children would get down on their knees and pray
And give up all of those things that pull our hearts away
You will forgive all of our wrong and make us brand new again

I got my foot on the devil while my other on the pedal
Plucked all the petals, all my luck ran out
Like it's goin' for the medal
So now I'm countin' all the blessings
Got one project, on deck
Check one like a mic check
Eyes set on two like my eyes vexed
Feel like I'm livin' two lives like a duplex
A suplex to whose next
Purpose is to perplex, you see
Makin' sure I see v, comin' after you next
On an ultralight beam
I been reapin' what I sew with the ultralight seam
You can never pull off the shade with my ultra sight, see
I'm Cyclops in Ray Bans pursuin' ultra hype dreams
Gotta x men out with an all black sharpie
Use my ultralight beams for the ultra marquee
See my name in the sky surrounded by all of my team
Screamin' ""Mama, we made it""
She in the very front seat
And I'm on an ultralight beam
[Interlude: Rocky Balboa and (Karina)]
Let me tell you something you already know
The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows, it's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are
It will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it
You, me, nobody is gonna hit as hard as life
(We on an ultralight beam
skrrt skrrt
This is a God Dream, this is a God Dream
This is a God Dream
We on the ultralight beam, ultralight)
But it ain't about how hard you can hit
It's about how hard you can get hit and keep movin' forward
How much you can take and keep movin' forward
That's how winning is done
Now, if you know what you're worth then go out and get what you're worth
But you gotta be willing to take the hits
[Break: AUSSY]
I'm on an ultra
An ultralight beam I done seen everything I need to see
Even if things I didn't wanna see that people did to me
People say I talk too much, but I don't care what they gotta say
Because they ain't me
You ain't me
You can't be me
Who am I?

You know what man, I'm used to y'all
skrrt skrrt
Fuck you! Shit you heard that?
I hated on y'all niggas before
But not on no ho shit, I just wanted your hoes
And I ain't gon' lie, I'll lie to a bitch
Quick as hell, you sick as hell, that bitch thick as hell
I let her get my pager, she let me get the cell
Picked her up, did her well, dropped her off, get my mail
Y'all know, she wanna page me all day
Wanna ride the dick like yippee Kanye
I figured though, long as she don't let a nigga know
Game tight, like ankles on Girbauds
And you know go getters be on these hoes
Genuwine, they wanna ride my pony though
Cause their niggas all lame, need to give back their name
Or return their jersey and retire from the game
Why this nigga wanna hate me mane?
Make me take it off safety mane, and make me aim
.380s make it hotter, 87 street
Eight deep in a Cadillac Escalada
That I just leased out with my pants creased out
When I pull the piece out, niggas like peace out

No I can't let 'em take me mane
They don't wanna see a nigga got it made, rappin' on stage
They'd rather see me packin' a gauge, and actin' my age
They say to get your eyes swole, let 'em know how I roll
Never seen six niggas jump out one Oldsmobile
Nah eight, bumpin' Ice Cube
I push rhymes like weight, with nothin' to lose

I was delivered in this world as a crack baby
Hard for me to pay attention and I act crazy
Gotta get over from the tip, I watch the fat lady
Sing a song, on how we guerillas in warfare
And I'm the kingest kong
They say we dreaming wrong
Them same strips that them older cats lingered on
Now the Walgreens is gone, hope is killed fiends are born
We leanin on a wall that ain't that ain't stable
It's hard to turn on the hood that made you
To leave we afraid to
The same streets that raised you can age you
With other black birds that's caged too
A rage up in Harlem and the southside
Brothers is starving with their mouth wide open
Floating across state got the workout plans so they can move weight
The fate of the black man, woman, and child: maybe

I ain't finna sit around and let the shit ride now, wait until it all dies down
While my people being murdered, what they doing here in Flint is genocide now
We can't turn a blind eye now, and keep quiet while they kill niggas
Someone gotta pay, they might have to the governor inside the Flint River
Corporate lies, leaked emails; treating niggas like we retail
Put your life up for a price, where the keep spinning like [spring wheels?]
Try'na breath but we suffocating, lead water that's intoxicating
Don't tell me it's coincidental, they want black people depopulated

Wanna catch that cab, right? Take back that bag, right?
I guess that she just gon' go buy herself that purse
I guess she just gon' go swipe, buy her self worth, that's cold
Now I'm the villain, no really I'm just chillin'
Tryna stack these 20s, 50s, hundreds, millions, to the ceilin'
Mary, Mary all I need, pussy, money, weed
And all my women in doubles, I'm at the DoubleTree
All I hear hoes callin' out wildin', on the road like every day
We everywhere, any day and anywhere that the money say
No questions, no questions please, just on your knees
Blow, don't sneeze, bitch shut up, don't breathe
Gasp, on the gas, 'til I crash, autopsy said that nigga mashed

You outside lookin in, so tell me what you see
Its about money it's bigger than me
I told my homies don't kill him bring the nigga to me, yeah
Don't miss, you fuckin with the hitmen
Kidnap a nigga, make him feel like a kid again
Remember how you ignored all my messages
Or how you didn't trust none of my blessings
Ya acting like you wasn't sprung ova-me
Oh this shit wasn't real, you just a phoney
And I admit that I took your time for granted
Doesn't mean you can take my love and have it
Don't ever act like I ain't ever hold you down
Hold you down, still fighting for this love Ronda Rousey now
Might've been afraid before but now we know
This love ain't like the movies girl, it just won't flow
Said that you was so sprung but we was under covers
You gassin to those losers what you chose to run from
skrrt skrrt
So go ahead & run this down, flip the script on all this now
How we Jay Z, Kanye run'd this town
Go and tell your homies now
Go tell your friends about it (About It) x2
Go tell ‘em what you know, what you seen
How I Roll, how I be on the low [oh]
Go tell your friends about it (About It)
Go tell you friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hurt
Singing bout broken love

skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Yeah, more, yeah
More time with family and friends, more life
More time to get it right
It's only me, but I'm seeing four shadows in the light
My demons visit me every night
To the most high, I'm forever indebted
I know I gotta pay somethin', I know that day's comin'
I put it all in the music
Because if I don't say it here, then I won't say nothin'
Could feel my hand getting tired from holding the grudges
Two birds, one stone, my aim is amazin'
I need to start losing my shit on you niggas that's hatin'
Too reserved, like I called ahead for me and my lady
Free C5, how the fuck we got the boss waiting?
Ever since the blue basement, I found God and I lost patience
Between rocks and hard places of all places
Spotted everywhere, like Dalmation
Cops snoop around now, 'cause all of my dogs famous
Please welcome the October fall baby
Vaughan Road Academy, star player—my mind's not all there
Used to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer
People too scared to tell the truth, so it's all dares
Count it, it's all there, and we all square
Quick money, I'm in and out
My dad used to use a soap bar 'til it's thinnin' out
But, shit, look at Dennis now
All Stacy Adams and linnen'd out
More blessings for Sandy and him, more life
My parents never got it right
But God bless 'em both, I think we all alike
We all wide awake late at night, thinking on what to change
If we do get to do it twice in another life
Scared to go to sleep now
'Cause being awake is what all my dreams were like
Back when the bar that I had set for myself was out of sight
Tell me how I went and did chin-ups
On this shit when I can't see it
Pin-ups of Meagan Good and Pam Grier
Soul sisters inspired my old scriptures
Now that feeling's gone like them old pictures
I did not diss Taylor Swift and I've never dissed her...
skrrt skrrt

5th thing I'm not even gone take credit for the idea… it's actually something Taylor came up with …

I can't be mad at Kanye because he made me famous! #FACTS 
I would like to sit down with Neil Portnow right now
I think the Grammys are super important!!!
I know so many cool artists whose hearts have been broken by the politics including mine
We need to fix this
I don't give opinions because they are commonly agreed upon. I say what I feel
I feel the Grammy awarding system is way off and completely out of touch
Hi Grammys this is the most important living artist talking
If I'm not at the show next year then there is no show
I don't want to just fix the awards for me but I want to fix it for Dexter Navy who directed A$AP Rocky's LSD video
Paul ... The most powerful messenger of the first century... Now we stand here 20 centuries later... Because he was a traveler...
He was a learned man not of the original sect so he was able to take the message to the rest of the world...
He was saved from persecution due to his Roman citizenship... I have the right to speak my voice... 
Please forgive the profanity and give hugs and blessings to my brother Kirk for standing by me... In a few hours the journey begins... 
All memes are wrong... The Life of Paul... The life of Pablo... Ultralight beams... Moms dads daughters sons stand up... 
I wanted to meet with Trump today to discuss multicultural issues.
These issues included bullying, supporting teachers, modernizing curriculums, and violence in Chicago.
Ten years ago today we finally released what had been my life's work up to that point: The College Dropout
I say ""finally"" because it was a long road, a constant struggle, and a true labor of love
To not only convince my peers and the public that I could be an artist, but to actually get that art out for the world to hear
I am extremely grateful to each and every person along that road who helped, lent an ear, lent their voice
I did not diss Taylor Swift and I've never dissed her

I just feel rich people are always too cool to ask for help trying to impress each other at dinner parties
I want to help the world and I need help to do it. I am an artist and I care about humanity
Yes I am personally rich and I can buy furs and houses for my family 
But I need access to more money in order to bring more beautiful ideas to the world 
If I spent my money on my ideas I could not afford to take care of my family. I am in a place that so many artist end up 
Also for anyone that has money they know the first rule is to use other people's money 
I could not have done the MSG without Adidas but world, what I'm telling you is that was just a small sketch for what I will bring you 
There are people who support artist and philanthropist 
And I think the idea of being a celebrity a lot of times blocks the understanding of what my purpose is 
Now - Media Takeout - always remember that you dissed the collection that changed the world
You seem like the type of organization hired to always keep dreamers down. when certain things in history happen you just got to respect it
Respect the struggle. respect the hustle. respect the dreams. respect the movement 
I had an album listening and clothing presentation and Madison Square Garden 
People were crying. people were throwing up the fist. people were dancing 
But Media Takeout couldn't say one thing positive knowing damn well you'd love to be on the YEEZY 350 list 
You probably got bootleg Yeezy's on right now 
I'm a human being. I'm an artist, bro 
Your site is entertaining and hilarious but certain things are just too far. you have no idea what I've had to go through 
# ok very serious question…
# whose job is it to carry the head on the plane # hash tag # do you check the mickey mouse head or carry on # does it get hot?
Has anybody ever heard of Bob Ezrin???
What the fuck does he know about rap…
I'm tired of old people that have no connection with anything trying to comment on music! 
Do something relevant… Please don't speak on me bro ever again!!! 
Your kids are ashamed of their dad… Sorry for speaking about kids… but could you imagine if you were Bob Ezrin's kids… 
I'm so sorry for them… I will send them free Yeezys to make up for the embarrassment that you have caused your family! 
Bro you said Macklemore was more important musically than me… no offense to Macklemore, he's a nice human being!

And thirty minutes later I was bringing his home
He was laying in the bed and he was playing with my head
And honestly may he said you wouldn't care
I said I wouldn't dare but inside he knew it
Like a missed opportunity man he blew it
I said what about your boyfriend he said ay yo who dat
He said ay Pr1me, show me how you do that
Said I'm a magician boy, call me Houdini

Let's have some fun now
Get up and touch it
Get up and touch the sky, come on [7x]
skrrt skrrt
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
Before the day I die, I'mma touch the sky
Testify
I'm up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got them hits to pop
The doors was closed, I felt like Bad Boy's street team
I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
skrrt skrrt
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line: ""Dawg, in due time!""
Now he look at me, like, ""Damn, dawg! You where I am!""
A hip-hop legend, I think I died
In a accident, cause this must be heaven
skrrt skrrt
Now let's take them hi-ah-igh-igh-igh-ighhhh(Top of the world baby)
(Top top of the world)
A-la-la-la-lah-la-lahhhhh(Top of the world baby)
(On top of the world)
Back when Gucci was the hits to rock
Back when Slick Rick had the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
skrrt skrrt
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Like ""Man - these niggas that much better than me?""
Baby, I'm going on an airplane

Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm trying to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song
skrrt skrrt
Now say: I'm, I'm sky high 
Feels good to be home, feels good to be home

skrrt skrrt
Please, pretty please
I just wanna see you down on your pretty knees
Or maybe you could touch it, see where it leads
Go 'head, just beat it like you was Billy Jean
You grown and you sexy, you following the fiend
That coconut Ciroc, see that's all we really need
You in college now, so you too old to tease
I hoping you can polish like Pledge what I need
And I ain't being selfish, we can't call it greed
Cause I return the favour like playing to the screen
I'm moving too fast, cause just when I believe
You came to shut it down like Drake and the Dream
Yeah, she claiming that she didn't know
How to kiss it like she standing under miseltoe
My love game got you feeling so official though
""Electro-convulsive therapy part one.""
I can't stop till we all ball
And walk around with gold in our mouth like Paul Wall
Nigga fuck all y'all
I'll just stay on the grind and sell out beats
Til I'm all over the hood like LRG
Matter fact all over Chicago
And I'm about to be on Oprah tomorrow
There's nothin' nobody can ever say to top that line
I'm in housewives' livin' rooms, stop that shine
Y'all already know Kan is a legend like John is
Rockin' that Louis Vuitton that only a don get
Got beef, bitches gettin' they Boost on
They bring me that Gucci I give 'em a Boost phone
Fel feel the new song so he give it airplay
Got calls 'bout Diamond from Nas and Jay on the same day
Fan's askin', ""Where yo ass been?""
Weak niggas been eatin' while you been fastin'
But you can ask Kaz 1
When my shit drop, y'all has-beens
Been gainin' popularity now I'm bout to cash in
I used to sell coke before I got in this rap shit
I wrap bricks now my [?] is a mattress
You runnin' from the cops, tryin' to get that lil' pack flipped
I'm runnin' round tryin' to stick my dick in an actress
The mac spit, it can make that ass do back flips
Smoke a nigga, I'd rather just poke a nigga like cactus
Come up off that [?]
Take a nigga's jewels then walk right past him with them on the next day
Goons
Mob get in, get in tune
It's plenty room
The back seats feel like a living room
He's a great
These left rights will beat your face
Poppin' bottles, my brother just beat his case
I up the iron, every one of you will bail
[2Pac audio clip]
“Yall got to back off my Benz. Back off my Benz”
“Yeah, I'm bout to run yall down, back of my Benz.”

With good understanding
And a lot of patience
You can make it, yes you can
Beyond your wildest dreams
Here we are in the prime of life
We're so ripe
Yeah the time's right
Here we go and we're high of expectations
Let's not waste them
Oh the sunshine in your eyes could break the ice
I can tell that you deserve the best in life
If I offer you the chance to live tonight
Then take it
We can make it

skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
To the world, to the world, to the world
skrrt skrrt
Middle fingers up!
(Motherfucker) Deuces minus one
Middle finger to the sky tonight (Ay, ay, ay)
The whole world is a couch
Bitch I'm Rick James tonight (I don't give a fuck)
Throw it up, throw it up cause you can't take it with you
Funny how they wait 'til you gone just to miss you
To the world, to the world then I'm on my Sinatra
I'm doing it my way, let's take it a notch up
Take it up
Let me see you put your middle fingers up!

Doing things my way, I'm burning shit down tonight

Dope money smell never smelled so good before. All this fake money imma burn this shit You know what I'm saying? I don't give a fuck about none of this money, you know what I'm saying? Real nigga
I got junkies in the hood writing notes on my whips
Tryna line up coke, I'm tryna sell off bricks
You be lying or what, whoa I don't trust a bitch
Niggas trust and they get done quick
Relationships in the hood will have you so sick
I got deep, but I don't love that bitch
What's your dreams cause mine be
Imma tell you what mines be
World War times 3
Divide that by the beast in me
I know the BasedGod that's what I'm supposed to say
Keep staying patient for the time being
Telling niggas that's up, I'm up next
I want the freshman next year
I'm fresher this year
Nigga I'm in 5th gear (5th gear)
Niggas hate when I switch gears
Nigga you late when you got here
I got dimes I got bitches
Boy you just a number…A-K-Hey, This four'll put you under…A-K-Hey
Them fans don't really trust you…A-K-Hey, That's why my family is fuck you
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I'm tired of y'all who thugging, cause all of y'all too hard
I'm tired of y'all and all I know is I am gonna tear you apart
How can Hip Hop possibly expose me when I'm so real niggas can't hold me?
Nickel's so ill miss me with the Loud talk I'm trying to be a player, you Chris Rock talking to Kobe
But I don't play sports, I play a little game called ""Make your face look like the front of Kanye's Porsche""
I'm getting better by the second you can feel it, can't ya?
And I'm still a gangsta, y'all niggas can play brothers 'till I kill 'em you feeling the little Willis, ain't ya?

There's no room for me to play now
Nowhere to dig my way out
My vital organs are beating through
My ribcage opened, my heart ballooned
I... I've lost another one
I'm on the floor trying to dress my wounds
Address the fact it was mine to lose
I... I didn't try enough
And when I'm left without your love
It could feel like a lifetime baby
And somewhere in the start we had it alright
Sunshine and blue skies, yes I recall
But now there's a darker blue
I'm bleeding and you don't care
The sun sinks and you're not there

Doesn't get much better than that (Nah!)
So unfair, so.. unfair advantage
(Yo, it doesn't feel much better than that)
It's the dream, it's Kobe and Jordan on the same team
In the best prime of their game and the same Kanye
You know the name and it's not pronounced Kane
And every time, you know I spit that flame
Ayo we gettin' out our dreams, gettin' out our dreams
And we gonna buy some things, and we got him out of Queens
Talkin' 'bout my man Consequence, once for the Tribe
Talkin' 'bout my man GLC and now he's around
Talkin' 'bout John Legend, take 'em all the way to Heaven
Speakin' of Heaven, Common speaks the heavenly words
The nouns and verbs and whatever you heard
Whatever synonym, we killin' 'em, everybody feelin' him
The people's choice, the people's champ like Paul Wall
All haters, I gotta say fuck all y'all
No, I won't waste my energy no more
I have to be more concerned about Sierra Leone
I'm talkin' 'bout people that's dyin' for diamonds
And the way that uh
They got uh, capa
What I want to say, monopoly over the country
And every time you say somethin' people act funky
The diamond industry want me, they say I'm bringin' out the bad
What I want, people to stop buyin' diamonds?
No, I want everybody to stop lyin'
They say conflicts is only one percent, and look at all the money rappers spent
We throw the diamonds in the screen, nah mean?
But it affects the families cause people is dyin' for these things
I mean in the diamond rivers they'll mine all day
And might only get paid two cups of rice a day
Is this the price to pay for the icy way?
We like to floss away, even your boy 'Ye
With my Jesus piece, I gave diamonds to my niece
If I had a brother, Kanye, Common made ""I Used to Love H.E.R.""
Used to love her and I still do, lyrically I kill you
Dog I don't feel you, your style is like mildew
Real old, I'm real cold, listen to this beat, real soul
Your style is real old, dollar bill fold
Stackin' money ain't funny, and I'm out in UK
And I ask 'em who's the best, and they say ""you K""
Ooh way ooh way
Yeah I feel it and I gotta kick it off the top of the dome
Microphone controller, that's an M.C., it's in me
I can lead a crowd, I went to your show, it's empty
Go to my shit, it's sold out, every single seat
Every time I drop, because like Shaq, I bring the heat
And anybody that freestyle on the level that I do
Should be winnin' Grammys too
So if you do it like me, you can do it like this
And uh, they say I'm a teacher like the one called Kris
That's KRS but nah it's Kanye West
And every time I spit the rhymes, uh straight off the flesh
I could bring it down to the bone straight from the heart
And from the heart is where I did it 'fore I ever chart
And then I spit it, we get it, we did it, we do it a lot
Kanye spit it, we do it, we makin' it hot
I got patterns like Saturn, the rings, the rings
Uh, Gold Digger, that's the single, the single
Gotta hit the club just to mingle, to mingle
Why you all in my face? I'm tryna do my thing dude
Back off, I'll have Barry smack the fuck out of you
Everybody wanna know what they can get out you
Aww here's my demo, dawg, here's my group
Dawg, please back me up, you're heated up, you're soup
Y'all gassed, I passed, I flow, I rhyme
I'm uh, that's the way, that yah boy gotta shine
Straight from the Chi city, everybody ride with me
And you see the same questions and I gotta teach the lesson
This some, this some sick freestylin', I hear you're readin' it
I gotta keep goin' cause y'all fans, y'all needin' it
Uh, you say I'm too high like I smoke weed in it
And they say ""he arrogant, he's always conceited, shit""
Well what you want from me? Y'all just can't stop me
You could look in my pants and tell that I'm cocky
[Bridge 1: Kanye West (Tim Westwood)]
(Laughing)
(Oh my God, Oh my God)
(Damn) Yeah
We back, we back like we ever left, huh
(Crazy!)
Like we ever left, huh, like we e', like we ever left, huh
Like we ever left, uh, uh, uh, yeah, yeah
Can I get an encore, do you want more?
Kanye on the Westwood tour
Chillin' with Westwood
Go to Chicago, that's Kanye West's hood
And the label called G.O.O.D
Should I holla at these bitches? You should
You might need one, you might need one
You might fuck one
If you eat out like McDonald's
I ain't no clown like Ronald
Uh, more like Donald
Trump, with the way I get it crunk
Like my man Lil Jon, but call him Lil Kan'
He all the same, flow like Lil Wayne on The Carter
And I'm signed to the Carter faculty
Cause the Roc is in back of me
Actually, that look like stacks to me
Ch-ching, ch-ching
Yah nahmean, yah nahmean, I'm doin' my thing
Out in U.K., London
And they call me number one
Japan, you're number one
That's Ichiban
And I learned that from KRS-One
Won once again like One
Like Puff, my friend, and One
One, give me one of them
Talkin' 'bout one drink, one hand
One cup of Henny, one cup of Hypno
If you ran out of it, yo, you got to get more
And I might sip slow but I never sip Mo
I sip Cris-o, Cris-y-Cris
And I gotta break it down like Missy Miss
She had the ""hee hee, who got the keys?""
You don't need that if you got the no start V
Where you push the button, that ain't nothin'
All y'all talkin' somethin', y'all stay frontin'
Kanye dropped the beats to get 'em jumpin'
Lucifer, top of the morning to yah
Cheerio, hit up the flow, bring it back, oh
From Chicago, uh
And I'm rockin' the Dolce Gabbana
Fashionable persona
G.Q., who knew he'd be the flyest?
Like T.W.A.C.W.K
K.A.N.Y W.E.S.T
Be the B.E.S.T
[Bridge 2: Kanye West (Tim Westwood)]
You know, I'mma stop it right there

I'm there for you, here with you, it's clear its crystal
I air before you only get stronger the things, you been through
I don't kill you thats what it'll do
Run with a few multiple-scribed, they say we belong in a fuckin' zoo
We done crashed all sorts of clubs forcin' the love
Often above them cowards and them so called thugs
When we come through respect is there, cause we demand it
Know the mobb is in the building, we officially landed
Keep your eyes on the man with the hammers, they can't stand us
Try to raid us the faggots snitchin' and got the cameras
Cock the cannons but shorty just keep dancin' cuz it might
Be a chance that it won't pop off
If it do stay close to the wall, we gettin' it on
You about to witness fellas who gifted in brawl
My homie Lyndon Erik Da Bob pissin' you off
This southern cat finnin' to get it so kiss ya cross
So if you goin' thru it but you won't let it hold you down
(Just throw up your hands) C'mon ma
We gon party to the crack of dawn lets get it on with the girls and me and my mans
[Prodigy]
Theres only few things I die for
Infamous my family, this money, sonny I hit the sky for
We don't take time off, we take rhymes off
Come with somethin better than that, to blow your mind more
Gettin our shine on... I think this due for a storm, hurricane Mobb
Rain on your parade and you can thank god
Or you can thank P, for simply not squeezin'

But I still got my glock cocked
New money mothafucka, don't ya see the big dot?
Don't see the big chain? Don't ya see the big rims?
Wonder who they hatin' on, lately paid for this meal
Candy paint, gator skin seats, call me Dundee
Pope in ya hood, I'm the boy that ya wanna be
Haters wish they could feel the wood in my '83
Ridin' with no tints so the mothafucka know it's me

(Intro) 
This the remix 
I mean, I ain't really into rims and all that 
If I'ma take, five, ten stacks of some D's it's gon' be a different kind of D's 
You know what I'm saying? Hm? 
(Chorus 1) 
Kanye's got stacks, ya'll already know that 
Louis that, Gucci this, just got a model chick 
skrrt skrrt
Just got a stripper chick 
skrrt skrrt
Something feel different... 
Cute little college chick, linin' up a scholarship 
Just got a school grant, spent that on some new tits 
skrrt skrrt
Ain't that a true bitch? 
skrrt skrrt
Let me show you how to do this shit 
(Verse One) 
Get you a cute chick, face got potential 
Working with her little hips, waist like a pencil 
Know how niggas play you, but you know how 'Ye do 
Says she love Beyonce, let me upgrade you 
Spanish chick grab my chain, says ""is that He-Su's?"" 
If I'm unfaithful, blame it on the Grey Goose 
All my friends says implants is a selfish gift, they all up in 
She ain't pregnant but about to have twins 
Now, is it real love, I need to ask Cupid 
She real smart but her ass stupid 
Through the wire
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
All of 'em coulda been lost
I always got to floss
I almost paid the cost
So before I go...
Every sunset feel righter, sunshines feel brighter
skrrt skrrt
Feel like God wrote this, I'm just here to quote this
I don't know if you noticed, them accident pictures is bogus
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Cause that trip to L.A. coulda been my last vacation
And, man, I know I can
Drop a down payment on that Porsche Cayenne
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I know God was holdin' my hand
Wouldn't let me go before I went before Def Poetry Jam
Wouldn't let me throw in the towel 'fore I got to throwin' some vowels
skrrt skrrt
Out the blue girls got a crush on me like I did beats for Mr. Cheeks
And since the accident, they tellin' me that it's the cheeks
But if you look at history, the last rapper that almost died
Sold 6.5 'cept I'm comin' from the Chi
Through the wire 
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
All of them coulda been lost 
I always got to floss 
I almost paid the cost 
So before I go to sleep sleep sleep 
Always thank the Lord 
For this mic and my keyboard 
Hecky naw that boy is raw

Wet bars on the boat, what broad won't elope
Crib like Scott Storch all from the coke
Maybachs were a dream now it's all real
It's hard to get sleep layin' next to five mil
Still got the chills, I call 'em the goosebumps
Yeah Alexander vision, I'm buildin' like two Trumps
Steppin' guce bumps I'm the main event
We got a pocket full of game, brain it made me ten
Six bitches' numbers all on the same napkin
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
You see it these niggas livin' of the past
I ran a hundred miles but I did it all with class
Hands all glass, wrist all glass
Mirror on the wall, how long will the crystal last
Champagne pours, celebrate the cause
Hover above the laws at the mercy of the Lord

What's worse, a testimony from you homie?
Tables turn fast, I told you not to fuck me, Tony
Started with the dishes, endin' with the digits
I had to cross friendship, it's rules to the business
All the time with a sister like Gina
Beauty salon dream, got the keys and the Beamer
On the way to cheetahs pointin' an army
Land my spaceship with the spoilers only
skrrt skrrt
To all my street niggas, project niggas
Real niggas, worldwide
Let's reflect, everybody got a story
We all ghetto B. Here's mine
See I was born in sewage, born to make bomb music
Flow tight like I was born Jewish
Used the streets as a conduit
I kept arms 38 longs inside my mom's Buick
At any given moment Shawn could lose it, be on the news
Iron cuffs - arms through it, or stuffed with embalming fluid
Shit, I'm going through it - mom dukes too
Tears streaming down her pretty face, she got her palms to it
My life is getting too wild
I need to bring some sort calm to it
Bout to lose it voices screaming ""Don't do it!""
It's like '93, '94, bout the year
That Big and Mack dropped and Illmatic rocked
Outta every rag drop, and the West had it locked
Everybody doing them, I'm still stretching on the block
Like ""Damn, I'mma be a failure""
Surrounded by thugs, drugs, and drug paraphenalia
Cops, courts, and their thoughts is to derail us
Three-time felons in shorts with jealous thoughts
Trying to figure where your mail is, guesstimate the weight you selling
So they can send shots straight to your melon; wait!
It gets worse, baby momma water burst
Baby came out stillborn, still I gotta move on
Though my heart still torn, life gone from her womb
Don't worry, if it was meant to be, it'll be soon
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Chill dog
Second oldest born, from Michelle Brown my mother
Hell bound, grew with two sisters and one brother
Pop wasn't around, so many stories that's another
I'm thinking damn; how my older sister goin' make me tougher
When steel sharpens steel, I'mma keep it real
I am an arms dealer
Fitting you with weapons in the form of words
And don't really care, which side wins
Long as the room keeps singing
That's just the business I'm in

skrrt skrrt
She said, ""Yeah, I've been spending all day trying to figure that out
You too?""
The arms race made 'em raise they arms and race straight to the top
Who knew?
Right now, they got the number one spot; do you want that?
skrrt skrrt
One thing I gotta call out boy
Take a look at Fall Out Boy
Since they ain't black
When they get money they don't ball out boy
Travie!
(Uh-oh)
Pete, thought I told you
What up, Hemmy
I see you!
I've had the world at arm's length from the get-go
This ain't an arms race, it's Apocalypto
The industry's a target, I suggest these labels get low
On top of that, this track is cracked like burnt brillo (damn)
Consider me the beast of Easter leavened
VIP, all day, AK47
If words is weapons, then get to steppin'
My arsenal's enough to send Hell's Angels to Heaven
I'm cool as the Fonz, and deadly as Charles Bronson
I'm Gonzo, you can call me Travie S. Thompson
Go 'head, and you can choose a similar path
But don't gas yourself up like Sylvia Plath, jeez
Watch Travie take the title with ease
You want a verse, please, I wouldn't bless you if you sneezed (achoo!)
Pardon me, I'm allergic to bullshit
Got a god complex with a full clip (pow!)
[Pre-Chorus: Patrick Stump]
This ain't a scene, it's god-damn arms race! (3x)
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, Oh-so intricate
Now I don't know what the hell this song is talkin' bout
skrrt skrrt
She said Yeah, I been spendin' all day tryin' to figure that out
You too?
The arms race made 'em raise they arm and race straight to the top
Who knew? (who knew?)
Right now they got that number one spot, do you want that? (want that?)
skrrt skrrt
One thing I gotta call out, boy, take a look at Fall Out Boy
Since they ain't black, when they get money, they don't ball out, boy
They just buy tight jeans till their nuts hang all out, boy
They figure 'Ye dress tight so we gonna dress tighter

Ahh... The sweet taste of victory
Go head and breathe it in like antihistamine
I know they sayin' ""Damn, Ye snapped with this beat!""
Fuck you expect? I've got a history
Groupie love now, gotta be them wheels!
Haters back down, gotta be that steel!
I know they can't wait till ya outta ya deal!
Look how they did D'Angelo ask em how do it feel!

As darkness approaches 
And I'm fumbling through the blunt roaches 
Its looking hopeless, totally unfocused 
Stumbling onto the front porch 
Poasty with my closest associates 
We were so broke 
Though a couple of us had sold dope 
Still humble enough to be po' folk 
We coming up to be grown folk 
Ain't dumb enough to be slow poke 
Though the hours of death they grow close 
So we give our lives to the utmost, Plus 
Here's an extra point 
Visualize the gold post 
No we not eating duck roast 
But we live our lives to the utmost, Cause 
Those pressure points 
Are the corners we cut close 
Turn most civilized 
Yaggers to cutthroats 
And it's these men they send 
up state by truck load 
And hurl 'em in to the pin like buffalos 
I'm saying 
skrrt skrrt
The game was sold, not told to me 
Heartache won't let go of me 
Games say that I'll live and lie 
But I'll trrrrryyyyy 
skrrt skrrt
For me it's Kanye West
I gotta fuck shit up
Let the champagne splash
Let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a, UH, depending how you dress her
So if the devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between but way more fresher
With way less effort, cause when you try hard
That's when you die hard
Your homies looking like why God
When they reminisce over you, my God
skrrt skrrt
I'm trying to get back
I want Q-tip to hear me
And so I could listen to this album everyday
I wanna get back to when I used to listen to (unknown) on the train wit' my headphones on
(Talking)
Ahhh... Take a sip of this..eh, let's go (yay)
I want you to feel this beat baby, come on girl let's go
Listen, (what's up), this ain't the way I wanted it to end

Kanye West Ft. DJ Khaled - Theraflu
I'm a writer, probably as good as Elton John
But whats writing good for if it ain't helping moms?
I'm tryna feed Japan while seeing sights of Lebanon
And wiping away tears of the girls that's getting felted on
I'm tryna get my felt pen on but the block is hot
My hands is questioning if I'm Bach or not
If I'm 2Pac or nonexistent to these juggernauts
But I'm an architect, an astronaut, an argonaut
So hey, you, get off my couch
You don't know me, stay the fuck out my mouth
But I'm a writer, you can quote it out loud
A false poet, get my dough and I'm out
But here's an eighth of shrooms for your earlobe
A little rap wrapped in cigarillo
A little bit of Wu-Tang, mixed with some Henry David Thoreau
skrrt skrrt
(doo-doo-doo-da-doo-doo) 2x
(never over) 2x
skrrt skrrt

Night
A night
Now I can't sit here and act like, my girl ain't...
Never did nothin' for me
skrrt skrrt
But right now she's just not the same...
Woman she used to be
And I tried to explain how I feel
But she just don't know what it takes
No, no
So I'mma take whatever time that I have...
And give it to you
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Takin' time hangin' out, bangin' out
Gotta give it to you
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
So from now on
My love is for you
Now I ain't gonna sit and complain how she never would cook or clean
Never would cook or clean
skrrt skrrt
If it wasn't for Christmas or my Birthday
She never bought me a thing
Never bought me a thing
But she had the nerve to turn around and ask me for a ring
No, but instead I might just turn it around and give it to you
Yo, it's Kanye To The
I did this beat in '96 and ah...
Is it the because my beats the nicest
Got me chargin' niggas Dr. Evil prices
Niggas will sell their soul to go platinum and gold
I'm cold cause I got the gold and kept my soul
Drop an album full of soul
Sold twelve times gold that's six plat
Man that's a sick plaque
Man don't forget that at the top is where you feel the loneliness
Like grabbin' fake titties, I swear I feel the phoniest
Cause I'm from a city where you never know who your homies is
Cause everybody wants your spot
No I.D. told me this
Oh I seen homies get
Shysty on me quick
Wooooh, just imagine if I only spit?
But I do beats too, that's the American dream
Stack two, make sure my shorties inherit some things
A couple real estate investments
Got niggas sayin', ""There's the Kennedys""
But oh yes it's, the Wests
Brand new Roc-A-Fella most fresh to death is
Definitely Kanye, peace to Sportie L.A
That keep my shoe game, early like the grave shift
Plus keep my closet cooped up like a slave ship
How you gon' look at me and say I ain't made shit?
Just look at my outfit, I got all the basics
Air Force, check
Rolex, check
Call Gee and Hop, did you get the, check?
Roc-a-Fella piece, check
Fuck
Do you remember when life wasn't so difficult
When you could just play Xbox and not give a shit
Listen to Metallica and 2Pac and not worry about shit
Well shit, I'm in alot of shit right now
I'm very fucking stressed
I'm worried if I can fucking pass high school
Or me not releasing any new music in a year
This shit is too clear
I just need to sit in my room and concentrate
Take my mind off this shit
And sit and not worry about how how bad the country is gonna be fucked up
It makes me wanna get fucked up
But I don't want jail time or deal with any pigs right now
Live from the BF Coliseum, southeast DC, Barry Farms where I was worked, born and raised! Wale, Kanye West and Dolla $ign! DC and Chi Town! Live inside the gates! Welcome to the big show!

All my bitches love me, the money keep comin'
Woah, you was just alright
Yeah you, okay
You know I could do this type of shit all night
Anyway, I wanna see you with the lights on, right now, for real
You got everybody watchin' like the fight on, god damn
Keep on, keep on thuggin', keep on, keep on thuggin'
While the money keep on comin', keep on, keep on comin'
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh huh, the Roc in here (yeah)
It's ya boy Kanye To The
Listen up man
I got girls in my room like hostages
Giving me neck like ostriches
Give some play to the real Kanye
Cause we all know who the impostas is
All my gangsters mob to this
And all my strippers do your job to this
Hell no I can't give you my cell phone
But you know where the hotel lobby is
For ya'll the same girls wouldn't give me no ass
Now I done highly surpassed my whole upper class
Bet if I meet her now I can fuck her fast, I pass
I be on some new shit
She don't believe I'm the shit at all
I know she suffered from withdrawal
No dope music playing at her call
Nothing to groove with, I'm sorry for you, girl
Uh, you know I'm speaking all this truth
I mean, why you sat there instead of breaking roofs
Going apeshit, girl, you'd be losing every tooth
You say you're like this but girl, where's the proof?
I see you talking 'bout it all day
Last night, you said you got off guys with your damn foreplay
Tryna make yourself sound like some goddamn whore, hey?
Girl, I know that's not you, quit lying bout it, shawty
I know you're really calm when you're alone
I know you miss your moms when you're not home
I know you want a son, them X Y chromosomes
I know you want it all, that I've always known
I miss the times when we would just chill
Regardless of the weather, laying on that hill
Unlike the other girls, you wouldn't take pills
That's why I fuck with you, you know you're goddamn skilled, girl
Man, I don't wanna waste my life
Wondering what it would be like if I couldn't see light
Fuck your fake love you can keep it
Niggers that are starving are the bruddas that I eat with
Didn't wanna holla now they want me on that remix
The same bitches that I couldn't get on, now the ones I sleep with
It's all crazy man, because shit was never like this just a year ago
I don't get excited because there's still another year to go
Kill these other rappers I said only if you dare me bro
Iv'e been going in but i don't think they really hear me though
Yo dice turn my mic up
Murmz get the torch, we gon' make the city light up
I just speak my thoughts so its unlikely that they like us
And all these niggers talk till I come around and fuck your life up
Look, how can i trust my girl in our relationship
When I be fucking girls who tell me that they're in relationships
Trust issues make me fuck around and take the piss
And see these broken hearts and then i pick them up and play with it
I don't need to, really I don't need to
But just know I still got, all the things that we've been through
All these niggers talk but they say nothing when they see you
People pick up new personas I prefer it when you be you
And people say I've changed, but I don't believe them because Mark said i'm the same
Nowadays I leave them to just say what they're saying

And the struggles of the brothas and the folks
With lovers under dope, experiment to discover hopes
Scuffle for notes, the rougher I wrote, times was harder
Went from rocky starter to a voice of a martyr
Why white folks focus on dogs and yoga
While people on the low end trying to ball and get over
Lyrics are like liquor for the fallen soldiers
From the bounce to the ounce, it's all our culture
Everyday we hustlin', trying get them custom rims
Law we ain't trusting them, thick broads we lust in them
Sick and tired of punching it, I look on the bus at them
When I see them struggling, I think how I'm touching them
The People
The days, have come
Now we, are one

I'm the one, baby
Yeah, I'm the one, baby
Since God gave his only begotten son, baby
It's hard preachin' the gospel to the slums lately
So I had to put the church on the drums, baby
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
You think you free but you a slave to the funds, baby
You think you me, but you ain't me, what you done lately?
Mm hm that's cool but I been runnin' on the sun, baby
We on a galaxy the haters cannot visit
That's my reality so get off my Scott Disick
If you ever held a title belt you would know how Michael felt
Tyson, Jackson, Jordan, Michael Phelps
Yeah, had to take it to another realm
'Cause everything around me got me underwhelmed
Best way to describe my position is at the helm
Best way to describe my new whip, yeeuum!
skrrt skrrt

You just popped in the Lil Jon remix of ""The Workout Plan"", and
And 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
And here come the 5 to the 7 and 6
I dropped out of college, I can't count worth shit
When the album dropped I was dissing this
Now everybody know this the shit
Part 2, this the update
First rule: stay away from the cupcakes
The second rule is so underrated
They claim the song was so degradin'
""But shit it's still my favorite
And he ain't talkin' 'bout me though""
Hello, then who I'm talking about, people?
OK, whatever you want to believe though
And I even took my own advice
This gut ain't nothing these hoes gon' like
I said, I look like LL
Took my shirt off, sheclaimed ""I can't tell""
But never said I can't sell
Pat, where we at, 3 mil?
Who the best now?
OK leave me out of it
Tell me who the rest now?
One and two and three and four and get them sit-ups right
And tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Pick up your son, don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and, ooh, she so excited
""Tell me who's invited""
""You, your friends and my dick""
What's scary to me: Henny make girls look like Halle Berry to me
So, excuse me, miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night, I came, I came, I came
skrrt skrrt
And she feel weak without me
She want to talk it out
But ain't nothin' to talk about
'Less she's talkin' about freakin' out
Then maybe we can work it out
Ooh, girl, your silhouette make me want to light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set, Twista said, ""Get it wet""
Ooh, girl your breath is harsh

All my niggas watches is rough, grabbing our crotches
Yelling what up? The jeans cost $500? Fuck
Stop it, keep baking, see, the smell it's a statement
One freeze of this shit, you won't feel your legs kid
I'm a gangsta corporate hustla, my voice is illustrious
Hounded by vicious dons, nigga we armed, trust me bruh
They yelling Chef, kill the plate with the cooks
I say 'Ye with 2 Chainz on, we Common, let's Push
Burn another bush, then burn another we brothers
Love us or not, the Mark Zuckerbergs of the block

All cause his pockets now knotty as his hair, yeah
All Sonny, no Cher, only solitaires
So now ladies and gentlemen this is star time
Are you ready for star time?
Life of the rich and gorgeous
Someone gonna be forging it
I told my dad I would have been aborted
If I wasn't the one that put the cord in
Pulling up in something looking foreign
Remember when a nigga couldn't afford shit

Intimate swift like a cash transaction
Speaker blows out from row house to the mansion
This ghetto sound rap, an arousal of passion
They don't know the language, but shoutin' the anthem
The beat translated make the world understand some
My voice like magic, my flow fantastic
In summary I'm rare, ordinary, elaborate
But check the profile, this is lyrically handsome
Resembles my pay scale, slim nigga, ain't frail
And I ain't in the gym on some Ebony man shit
I'm in the laboratory, bench pressin' the standard
It's your hand, I'm liftin' the bar [?]
Get close to the Gods, stay focused and sharp
It's High stakes and there's way more than paper involved
You must evolve or die, that ain't falsified
Home team I know you keep trouble on your mind
Don't let bullshit knock you off your grind
And that's real talk for all of mine and for all of yours
I rock steady, keep your bounce of course
I'm low key, cool breeze, man I'm 'bout my balls
Tap tap, knock down your door
Tap tap and break down the wall, collect and count it all
And like ""Bang"" in the air, I'm gone
See I'm ridin' on, keep cool, you can ride along
But keep it up, you won't ride for long
And that's word to God, BK show me where you are
Word to Lord we the brightest stars

Winter in America, never knew white Christmas
'Cause L7 squares always making my shit list
Spring is in the air and all the flowers are blooming
The powers that be wanna devour the movement
Tears disappear when they fall on the summer rain
Bleedin' through this mic, but they call it entertainment
Running across stages is a drug
Is like a blunt that we crumble in raw papers
Call it the lord's name 'cause we taking it in our veins
Like the feeding us intravenous
It's war and we fighting for inches and millimeters
They try to stall the progress by killing off all the leaders
If we don't give them martyrs no more, they can't defeat us
This lack of justice got us disgusted, look at our faces
All these soldiers hate but I saw military training
The force flags fly at a half mast this morning
Take a bow, this might be your last performance

I do it for the fore-fathers and the street authors 
That are not A&R's in the cheap office 
Rappers that never got signed but they keep offers 
Girls thats way too fine for us to keep off us 
Gave her a handshake only for my man's sake 
She in her birthday suit cause of the damn cake 
Now there's crumbs all over the damn place 
And she want me to cum all over her damn face 
I never understood planned parenthood 
Cause I never met nobody plan to be a parent in the hood 
Taking refills of that plan B pill 
Another shorty that won't make it to the family will 
If I don't make it, can't take it, hope the family will 
They aint crazy they don't know how insanity feel 
Don C just had a shorty so it's not that bad 
But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had

Nah, you aint listen, they black, they sisters 
They momma named them after white bitches

Good morning America, good morning to Erica
Who gave me good head while watching good morning America
And good day New York, have a good day in court
My niggas drive around the hood looking for good ye' to snort
I never liked the goodbyes, always caught a good vibe
Always had a good time, could always spot a good guy
From a good guy, look alive, look alive, look or try
You know that old saying what they say about good guys
I bet that's why I went bad, needed all my chips bad
Fiends needed it bad, started hittin' liq' bad
Had to get that work off before that shit went bad
If not, it gets bad, and things will only get bad
So now I'm getting bad skin, and I got that badge and
Tellin me them bastards, don't catch a bad break
Caught a bad rate on whip with bad brakes
I'm caught up in these bad ways havin a bad day
So now the game's ugly, and my pain's ugly
And my chain's ugly, things became ugly, 'cause I'm ugly ducklin'
Got a stain and its musty, wakin' up looking crusty
And miss thang who's ugly is sayin' to me ""don't touch me""
I went from pretty willie to pretty silly
But I'm still pretty gully so you thins will still get pretty ugly
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
B.I.G. said get ya money ain't no telling they gon love me
skrrt skrrt
When your money get funny and them days ain't sunny
skrrt skrrt
Niggas give pounds and hug me, tho they really wanna slug me
skrrt skrrt
And this for the hood, you got to love me
Good morning to ummm, I don't remember your name
But I remember the brain, here go a fare for the train and
Good morning to Chi-Town, where my niggas ride down
And bust clowns, and look for some bustdowns to bust down
And she ain't got a car she on the bus now
But her gear is bangin', she one of us now
I wanted badly to bone 'cause she was bad to the bone
She from a batter home, she mad when she at home
So I gave her my number to beep off, she wanted to take a week off
Bustin scary movie nuts, I had to get the freak off

That new Tom Cruise to the Moulin Rouge 
On a too long cruise, she said I ain't bonin you

Dog, are you fucking kidding? My hat, my shoes, my coat 
Louis Vuitton stitch, with Donatella Versace 
That's Louis Vuitton bitch 
I think Hennessy, I drank, I'm gone 
Off that Bacardi Limon and Corona, I'm zoning 
Class back in session so I upped it a grade 
Two years Dwayne Wayne became Dwyane Wade 
And, hey, please don't start me 
I'm like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley 
I'm pop the Barkers, I'm hood the Parkers 
While y'all was in limbo, I raised the bar up 
I touched on everything 
Married to the game, roc-a-chain 'stead of a wedding ring 
Y'all bridesmaids catch the garter 
On nights when Ye romance, cameras flash so much 
That I gotta do that Yayo dance 
I'm on a world tour with Common, my man 
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van 
It's easy, the hood love to listen to Jeezy and Weezy 
And, oh yeah, Yeezy, I did it for the glory

I still remember when Damon Dash asked me to put Kanye on Def Poetry Jam. I didn't really know Kanye as a poet, I just knew him as a producer who was part of the Roc-A-Fella (which was a Def Jam company) crew, making hit records for Jay and ‘em. His appearance on our HBO show blew a lot of people away that night, including me…and from that point on, Kanye soared.
I recently sat down with Ye in New York and got the chance to hear about his hopes and ambitions, his frustrations and contradictions, his happiness and his anger. But through it all, what I felt from Kanye was an artist who desperately wants to leave his imprint in the history books. What's often times misunderstood about Kanye is that people believe he wants all of this for himself, in fact, quite the opposite, he wants all of this for the rest of us. He wants to destroy the glass ceiling with 808′s and crack music…so one day WE have the power to see all of the lights. Certainly he wants a piece for himself…everybody would, but at his core, at the bottom of his heart, lies an inner-truth that has led to an external battle to make this world a bit easier for those who have been dealt a hand of struggle, by showing them a glimmer of hope through his art.

Raised by game where niggas ain't phased by fame
Come to the crib, get banged, they take your chain
Stay in your lane, Brokeback ain't the way of the game
My brainstorm is like I stay in the rain
My favorite was Kane, now I'm dope with weight in the game
You was hot but can't stay in the flame
Ghetto pain and windows crack, the fist is like a symbol for black
Can tell the real by how the real interact
In the middle of whack my soul sticks to a track
Kickback records get kicked to the back
I want big cribs and my man Ronnie to get his
Child in a good school and know what her gift is
It's global warming, the world is shifting
Watching Sweet Sixteen, Bitchin-ass rich kids
Who don't know in life you gotta go the distance
Whether yoga or doja, we all get lifted in the Game

I never kissed the ass of the masses, I'm the black molasses
Thick and I lasted past these rat bastards
They try to box me in like Cassius Clay
Hey I'm like Muhammad when he fasted
Opposing the fascist, make cuts and got gashes
Scratches over third eyelashes
Punchlines are like jab hits to rappers
I kick the most awesome audio. Plainly put
I run these tracks like cardio insane with hooks
I banged the books, then I used to hang in the streets
It's no tricks here, yo, my flow is a treat to listen to
Especially if it's written dude, it's critical
I disintegrate rappers into minerals, in general
You can't specify my genre. Fortune 500′s they looking to sponsor
So they throw the cash out, then I cash out
I'ma get it in homie goin mask out
Duck and gas the dude up, nah, you ont wanna do that
Cuz I'm running on E
Kinda like my dude Drake say
I'ma do this thing and I'm making
The C.R.E.A.M kinda like WuTang Clan
Yea I'm the man around this land, it would be Toledo
And spitting is a free throw taking off like Rockets
Homie got the whole f***in game in my pocket like
Nintendo DS but its DC from the SC P.S

Right about this time raise your glasses
What's my motivation, that ass is
Start a conversation, like as if
skrrt skrrt
Go ahead and tell the DJ to play Swizz

Bitches hatin' again that's music to my ears
What's you think my fuel was for all Of these years?
skrrt skrrt
It keep me writing so exciting
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
And just too fly a motherfucker show your chain
Throw your cash, that's cake and icing
I asked her 'you buying?'
She said 'no just sight seeing''
Maybe that's just because you ain't found the right thing? yeah!
skrrt skrrt
Let me show you what is like to be the wife
Of a nigga with a life
That make your head spin around
See it's funny coz I know what you like
But I be see'in you with niggas that ain't right, round hard top
Know'in that you really, really want's your top down
Know'in really that it's time to stop a run around
We don't live twice, only life once
And I know you like nice
So how you gone front on me?
Baby, I'm the boss JD
With him its a limit
With me its a spree
Ellen: How do you think marriage has changed you, if it has?
Kanye: I've definitely learned how to compromise more. Which is something you have to understand when you partner with people in business. You know, you can't--
Ellen: Beautiful
Kanye: And I've learned how to shut up more and, um, I've--yeah. I think--I think I'm a better human being, you know, because of her
And because of my daughter. And I have, you know, always someone to think about going home to and, you know, something for me to, you know, not only be brave for what I wanna do for humanity but also to be more protective of myself for my family too. Cause there's things I've done in the past that were considered negative, but I was really, you know, jumping in front of the tank for other people or for culture in a way. So now I always have to have that in my mind, that I have, like, a family that I have to protect too
Ellen: Mm-hmm. Yeah, and I do see that change in you. I see you-- And you are calmer, I think. You know, you don't seem, like, uh... like, uh...angry or--you know? You know what I mean? And I don't know if it was even anger, but it was just the way that you were getting all of your emotions out. And now I think your emotions
Are grounded in a way that they come out in what you said and protection and love, and--and--they're going-- they're channeled
In a different way
Kanye: I think I was, like, going through now, like, my version of my terrible twos. My--my daughter, she wants to express herself, but she just doesn't have the words for it. And for me, there's so many things I wanna do with film, with clothing, and I just didn't have the words or the resources or the backing or the perception that I could do it, being that I was a rapper or, you know, all these things. And now, because of this Adidas deal, they allowed me a little bit of oxygen. Because what you have to understand-- The difference between, you know, what people give you about celebrity, the idea of money versus creativity. There's no amount of money that someone can give you to make you not be creative, if you were born to create. So a lot of times people try to block you, block your creativity, control you with money. And Adidas allowed me to make my whole clothing line, which I wanted to do, and it was just like a little bit of oxygen. You guys last year, two years ago, three--whatever. You guys were seeing someone being suffocated by a perception. Being suffocated by people in a position that could
Blatantly see like, ""Wow, the ""Yeezys"" did really good. He was this influential. All those albums did this. But we're not gonna give him
A shot in something else."" And there's a lot of people who, like, were really calm about that. But the definition of crazy is trying to do the same thing and expecting a different result. So I tried something different over the past couple years. And I actually got some really good results from it too, so...
Ellen: Well put. Well put. And that is true. I mean, I think we all try to express ourselves. And you do, you keep doing the same thing and saying the same thing and saying the same thing. It doesn't get
The result you want until you try a different way of expressing yourself or whatever it is, and then you get the result because you've shifted. We have to take a break. And then we're gonna show the world premiere of your new video, which I absolutely love. I love this song so much. You actually played it for me in our living room, and I just was blown away how beautiful the song is
Cut
Ellen: So, uh, more kids?

You know, one connection that I have, you know, to, I believe everyone in this room, but especially with like me and Virgil and Don C and Fonzworth Bentley and all the people from the infamous Tommy Ton then transferred to South Park photo. Have dealt with in their life somehow, you know, being ridiculed for liking fashion. For that being a career you want to take up. Like even with the stylist that I work with that's my.. I always call her my baby of M.A.S. [?]. “You're my M.A.S. and I'm your Nicholas.” And her brother's a doctor. And somehow in her family she's looked at like she didn't do as much in her life ‘cause she did fashion and something. You know, and, she was the little girl that eight years ago showed me who Emmanuelle Alt was. Back when I was, you know, less informed about how to put my shit together
And I honest.. I'mma jump to a point just so I don't take too long. I believe that the world can be changed. The world can be saved through design. Through unselfish design. Through unselfish creation. You know, God is the number one creator. I'm a Christian, I'm not tryna push my opinions on anyone. But in my opinion God is the number one creator. And we, anytime we, you know, create, we're extension of doing his work on Earth. While we're here what can we do for humanity? And, you know, in a way, the fashion is what defines the time. People could think in some way they're higher classes, some higher statuses that contribute more to the world because, you know, they work on bombs, they work at technology, they, you know, they school teachers. Whatever it is that seems to be somehow that type of profession that when you say it everybody is, “oh, you're a lawyer? Oh great.. lawyer? Motherfucker.” No knock to lawyers, but you know what I'm talking about. So there are no movies without fashion. We define the times, we set in stone. What did 2015 mean? What did 2014 mean? You know? I always told Anna - “I wanna be in the middle of that conversation.” As we all know, The Devil Wears Prada was about Anna .. I said, “I wanna be in the middle of that conversation.” Nah, I'm saying.. we know this. So, where.. she was talking about the blue sweater. And previous to Instagram and all that type of shit do you know this conversation, “you think you not part of fashion because you don't datatata.” Like the blue sweater, okay, you would know this. And somehow like me and my crew, you know, like all these straight, black guys from Chicago that no one knew why they were at the fucking show. You know, wanted to say, let's make the conversation, you know, let's make the conversation shorter between, you know, when the blue sweater goes from a Wang show to when it finally hit Kohl's' or something. Pre-Instagram, pre all that shit, pre people, you know, wanted to show what they had, before images were the new currency
Cole World, the new Nat King
If I ain't the illest nigga, I'm his new vaccine
Really more like poison when his New Jack Swing
And my bed is like a deck of cards - two black queens
A nigga don't like me, he just a fucking hater
What you made last week, I just tipped the fucking waiter
What that feel like? Tell me what that feel like?
Nigga fuck your Twitter, bitches follow me in real life
skrrt skrrt
Welcome back, ladies and gentleman, to a brand new season. Dreamville, Cole World. So much has happened in our time apart. I can't wait to share it with you all in due time. Did you miss me? I know I missed you. Can't believe these niggas ain't rap on this shit man
Heard niggas got beef
Then they see me on the street, and don't speak
Heard niggas dropping songs every week, but they weak
Yeah I heard about your deal, hope they keep the receipt
Heard niggas out there saying I would be Memphis Bleek
Well, how you feel when that nigga got mills?
And you sitting, commenting, discussing on how you feel
Bout another nigga shit, or another nigga chips
Meanwhile I'm on the strip, putt puttin' wit ya bitch
Cut something in the 6 then dip to 160
Bitch don't fuck with me, trust nigga I'm sick
Can't tag me, fuck nigga I'm it—watch this
With my heart on my sleeve I bleed pardon my greed
I plead insanity, with a side of vanity
How can it be I blew up singlehandedly
Nobody handed me shit
Granted though, I planned to be rich
Understandably, funny how I talk so candidly
On cameras but won't holla at family only randomly
After a few drinks come our realest convos
My handle on my thoughts used to be as ill as Rondo's
Screaming fuck whitey, forgetting I'm still mulatto
Ay reverend, will I get to heaven, he said “hell if I know,” shit
Stay scheming, day dreaming, chain gleaming
Name should be Abe Lincoln ‘cause I cannot tell a lie though
All facts in fact, been all that
Before Kenan and Kel swallow the key to my cell
Which means, I got an impossible lock to pick
And if you want my spot, you gotta go through lots of shit
Nigga, Cole the truth, you the opposite
skrrt skrrt
I open my eyes, the corner's like African tribes
The blackest of thighs, a blackened surprise where passion arise
The youth fantasize of grass and cash in they eyes
A youth dies, and momma's asking rationalize
Trying to build a spot where ghetto bastards can rise
The ghetto's been bastardized by those that capitalize
Wonder if it's a plan that the master devised
To bring his people to a land where blacks are despised
To act you lie scriptures, the rich are getting richer
The young are becoming thicker, summers becoming winter
Hard times, hard liquor link cards and God figures
It's moments that completes us to piece us with scar niggas
The corners I picture in motion it stars niggas
Emotions of those that be smoking like Todd Bridges
These are our bridges, from nothing to something
That's why on every city block, you hear them pumping
The corner
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
On the corner, birth place of various dreams
The ending of the beginning, the scariest thing
As we survive here to die here, whatever we seen
We accept it, live with it, or better the scheme
On the corner, the backdrop for hustling crack rock
The spot where the [?] stops to issue the pack [?]
There's money on the corner you'd be stupid to pass up
Remember there's a code and if it's broken we blast ya
There's Crips on the corner, Bloods on the corner
GDs and vice lords so there's thugs on the corner
skrrt skrrt
Memories on the corners with the fo's and the mo's
Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes
Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose
To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows
In their socks and their soles, niggas holding they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed, hoping for mo'
With nowhere to go, niggas rolling in droves
They shoot the wrong way, cause they ain't knowin' their goals
The streets ain't safe cause they ain't knowing the code
By the foes I was told, either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don't roll
Down the roads where cars get broken and stole
These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove
The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove
On the corners
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt

skrrt skrrt
Street lights and deep nights, cats trying to eat right
Riding no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes
So they can get sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right
Desires of street life, cars and weed types
It's hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like
skrrt skrrt
He came back, in the same suit that he was buried in
Similar to the one his grandfather was married in
Yes, he was still fresh to death
Bling, two earrings, a chain layin' on his chest
He still had it cause they couldn't find it
And the bullets from his enemies sat like two inches behind it
Smelled the Hennessy from when his niggas got reminded
And poured out liquor in his memory, he didn't mind it
But he couldn't sip it fast enough
So the liquor was just fillin' the casket up
Floatin' down by his feet was the letter from his sister
Second grade handwriting simply read ""I miss ya""
Suit jacket pocket held his baby daughter's picture
Right next to it, one of his man's stuck a swisher
He had a notion as he laid there soakin'
He saw that the latch was broken
He kicked his casket open and he
This life goes passing you by
It might go fast if you like
You born, you lived, and you die
If life goes passing you by, don't cry
If you're breaking the rules, making your moves, paying your dues
Chasing the cool
Not at all nervous as he dug to the surface
Tarnished gold chain is what he loosened up the earth with
He used his mouth as a shovel to try and hollow it
And when he couldn't dirt-spit, he swallowed it
Working like a, hmm, reverse archaeologist
Except, his buried treasure was sunshine
So when some shine through a hole that he had drove
It reflected off the gold and almost made son blind
He grabbed onto some grass and climbed
Pulled himself up out of his own grave, and looked at the time
I'm on The Come Up
Chill nigga, don't run up
A yellow nigga, finna' rise and shine like the sun up
My mind on that paper, I ain't trying to wife the slut up
I'm dying for this cake and I ain't trying to wipe a crumb up
They ride with the gun up, kill you and light the blunt up
Uh, don't shed a tear if a nigga might get done up
But, just say a prayer if a nigga might confront us
Cause his life is summed up, the medics wipe his lungs up
You coming to the 'Ville? You need to get a license from us
City on my back, I feel like I'm holding Big Pun up
No pain no gain, my nigga, I just numb up
I blow brains, Cobain a nigga if he jump up
With no shame, don't blame a nigga if you shot up
This is cocaine on flame, baking soda and water
And if you feel that then I guess I sell crack, get it?
Fall back, man, a nigga feeling crazy
Shitting on niggas like a nigga was still a baby
Carolina nigga shout-out to the 'Ville that raised me
So many hoes whipped, you would've thought we still in slavery
And niggas still sleepin they feelin lazy
Uh, a killer maybe, you make me I will
Cheat me on my scrilla, I send you to meet Dilla
From them NC streets where the beef they deliver
Uhh, just point out the bounce
Uh-huh, show me the bounce, yeah
Just point out the bounce, yeah
Timbo the king, yeah
Young Hov' the king, yeah
Just point out the bounce
Yes, just point out the bounce nigga
Yo, listen
Rumor has it The Blueprint classic
Couldn't even be stopped by Bin Laden
So September 11th marks the era forever
Of a revolutionary Jay Guevera
Now it's a whole museum of, Hov MCers
Everybody dupin' the flow, you see 'em
Everybody loopin' up soul
It's like you tryin to make The Blueprint 2 before Hov
Shout out to Just Bleezy and, Kan-yeezy
See how we adjusted the game so easy
Chicks barely dancin, glancin every chance they get
Like - oh shit, he's so handsome
Still in demand in the longest run standin
Kidnap rap seven years, no ransom
Can't one nigga get it back no rap
Young Hov's goin to Canton, I'm now eligible
Point out the bounce - and show you how to get this dough in
Large amounts 'til it's hard to count
Point out the bounce - I turn a 8 to an ounce
To a whole ki to the R.O.C
Point out the bounce - Timbo the king nigga
Uhh, yeah, uhh
Point out the bounce - jeah, Young Hov' the king nigga
Uhh, I got y'all

8. OFF THAT: JAY-Z + DRAKE
[Produced by Dave Tozer, Hit Boy & Kanye West]
Last night was the last night
You'll ever spend alone
Couldn't wait, did it in the living room
Soon as I saw you, baby, I had plans
Plans to do it 'til we have a baby
Even if the world is crazy
Pick some names, boy or girl
Then we'll change, change the world
So after you change your clothes
Girl, if you change your mind
I'm ready, whatever time
It's the beginning of forever
CHILDISH GAMBINO & LUDWIG GORANSSON - TELEGRAPH AVE 
At number 5 we start with the conceptually beautiful ""telegraph ave. (""Oakland"" by Lloyd). Partners in crime Donald Glover & Ludwig Goransson deliver an 808 bass line and intuitive use of equipment to snare a nostalgic sound. I had the pleasure of speaking to Goransson about the beat and he commented on the use of an iPhone microphone to capture Donald's voice, essentially making him sound like a sample. It worked wonders, the overlap of Donalds crooning on the aged sonics works a treat!
NOAH ""40"" SHEBIB - TUSCAN LEATHER At #4, Noah ""40"" Shebib literally flips the script on a Whitney Houston track for the intro to Drake's album Nothing Was The Same. The elaborate introduction is comprised of not two, but three different instrumentals as ""40"" flexes his full diversity as a producer. A new feature of Producer Genius includes an interactive Soundcloud breakdown, with such a complex beat be sure to check out the official Producer Genius breakdown here, just like 10,000 other people did!

Push all limits, you lookin' timid, need to back off

Shit, niggas only concern is the bottom line like a stockholder
This is where they come, where they cop them boulders
Hoes catfight with their tits exposed
Still sippin' on that Wild Irish Rose
Still rock swap meet designer clothes
Black MAC 11 in my mattress
Make a hundred racks do a backflip
Might go Uncle Luke on them hoes
Pussy pop for a bankroll (yeah)
All my killers with me got a blank face (yeah)
On that fuck you, bitch, where the pay pay?
Make 'em pull up on your block with them 223s
Aim it at your face, hey

You either sellin' rock or you flock to get it
You either on the watch or the clock is tickin'
The life of my Watts and my Bompton niggas
Get pinched, I'ma post a bond
Know POP gon' hold it down, look
Need cash, gotta get you some
If a hater tell you money ain't everything
He don't want you to get none

Bleed shit, PMS
Point blank, period, meet me on the ES
I'm fully with the BS, believe that!
And we don't stress

Hold your breath, I'm 8 feet when I hold this TEC
Protect me from the local threats
My ID say my eye don't rest
My IV qualify T-rex
Society kept my IQ vexed
Deny me from an Ivy school
Applyin' me to the street I slept
I quietly had to hold this tool
Reminding me of the block I repped
The turf I stepped, the church and the earth I blessed
The first I guessed the alert was the murk I chef
That hearse the flirt with perks of a kill confessed
Dispersed the worst, the first 48 addressed
The search and laws and verse of the birth I nest
The awe, the curse of a pose in zest
The good, the flaws, the pain to reverse what's left

Intro [DJ Boom]
DJ Boom, beats on streets and here with my man Kanye West
Producer of H to the Izzo, Takeover and all that. Let them know man
[Kanye West speaking]
Yo, it's Kanye to the man. Just play my shit man
Let a nigga hear somethin' finally. (Holla)
Yo, DJ Boom, back for the first time. It's really my first time yo
This is...Kanye to the. Not on the beat though
You know what I'm sayin'? ON the beat motherfuckers
What up G? What up Hop? Look, c'mon
As a shorty had a Schwinn, look that's the best bikes
Shorty had three friends, that's my best dykes
Said her best friend wanna see what Kanye West like
Cause her man dress like a transvestite
You ain't know I get a deal because I rhyme tight
Sport Rocs before your deal to be an Unsigned Hype
Give a fuck about your rippin' down some open mics
I'm gonna go ahead and give you these beats for free, psych
You rappers too lame, you ain't James, y'all ain't worthy
I fly out to Newark just to get some new jerseys
I be back to Chi about every two Thursdays
I can't buy water around niggas too thirsty
I can't rock ice around niggas too hatin'
Can't rock Motorola, niggas two wayin'
I Alter like Beast in an altercation
Infrared make you juke like Walter Payton
So, grand theft auto
Come up out your auto
Mobile, before I pull more steel than Soprano

Woo, welcome to the bank
Where you deposit Young Money and you get Cash Money
I'm Tunechi the Boss
And live from the vault is Busta Buss
Swag mania, pop that goes most
Carry the most beautiful bitches
With us, happily toast
Keep the faculty close
Gross when we give them a dose
Got them ODing, leaning in each coast
Scenery froze, take notes, Rock Rolls
Diamonds that fit in Chanel Minks in the winter
Who fucking with us
We coming to give them the shivers
Watery flows, spilling like rivers
Flooding the street, hoping niggas swimming is moving gorillas
King Kongs, Godzillas when we roll up
Seat filling niggas, get up when we show up
Please don't throw up
Hold your liquor, grow up
If you robbing niggas
We going to show you how to blow up
Thank your lucky stars
It's the Rap Czar, tuck your shit in
My niggas bite like Rin Tin Tin, my chagrin
You never win, model thin, walking crack in your shin
She gives in every time that I spin
Square up, bow down to the kings of the hall
We wade on, talk shit while we ball
So what's cracking with y'all
Native New Yorker
And the slick talker keeps it in order
Call the reporter
Stepping like the British walkers
Legendary swag flu and see the influence, see how we do it
Get them into it steadily God, I'm stupid, so undisputed
Act fool, back tool, until they pop off
Police crowd up the street, blocking them off, locking them off
Got these niggas wilding while I signal my soldiers
Bossing it up, maintaining composure, stand on the sofa
Thirty bottles, twenty waitresses, bring them over
See how we light up shit, nigga, call the promoter
And tell that nigga bring the bag, better hurry up with it
And count the money up proper, cause you can GET IT

Verbal asked me do I need a pen?
Not right now
Everything I write now
I don't even write down
I don't need her right now
But I'm so bad
Ask her can she hold my gonads before they go bad
Since I did a song with Teriyaki I been acting very cocky
Using every opportunity to shit on everybody
If you heard I'll be in Houston like Bobby
Puffing on a blunt until the ""B"" got me body
There fees in the party?
Chillin' in the lobbies
Anything you heard happened, yo it probably did
Full Force trying to find where the Party is
For the last time to kick it like Karate Kid
Man that line was way obvious
Way out of my jurisdiction of my high snob
On my job kill a nigga no prob type flow
Just seen a nigga get Rob like Whoa!
Oh, should have tucked your chain
Niggas ain't playing man, it ain't a fuckin' game
Live from the Waldorf in Berlin
Coming at you once again
With stories of truth and stories of sin
Yeah, the ball is in your court
No defense, nobody's keeping score
No offense but I've played this before
Maybe you can and you just don't care anymore
Evolving, evolving, evolving, e-yeah
And I'm right back here when I said I wouldn't
You were never a good girl but you're a better woman now
skrrt skrrt
Look, you remind me of Jane Birkin
Your body insane in person
Wanna do special things for you
You deserve it
But you're too famous to buy you purses
That barely scratches the surface
This time is different, you give me purpose
Tell me you taking it serious
I gotta ask how serious?
Cause your serious has just been not that serious
Got me on tour acting like I'm not that curious
Ignoring all the pussy that's thrown at me
Been thinking 'bout home actually
Where Roxx has Kim and Mark has Ashley
And Niks has Ezee
And I, I don't even know what I have anymore
skrrt skrrt
We are not the same I am too reckless
skrrt skrrt
These niggas they been doing too much flexing
And they're about to call the wrong attention
And I ain't got no patience, no more testing
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessing
XO niggas ain't nothing to mess with
Nobody stopping us, oh no we're destined
And everybody around you is so basic
I'm never rocking white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor with a chasin'
And money is the only thing I'm chasin'

Make sure you tell em every detail
Make sure you CC em on that email
Talk how that Mercedes gettin' detailed
Mention that new C.C. back at retail
Them hoes be jel, never wish me well
Told my lady that I'm leggin' bitches like I'm Miguel
Big mouth bitch we just call her Gmail
You know everybody had her Gmail
My nigga Craig said, ""Debow, that's a female""
I say she fuckin like a nigga, that's a She-Male
Every crew have a Shady one just like D12
All she ride is dick, you riding that V12
In that S6, talking on a 6S
Not no gossip just making moves at success
These bitches flexin' on a baller alert
Guess they don't know, that's a bitch who need baller allure
Gossip just a broke people sport (Oh you ain't know)

You feelin' yo'self, I'm the one that numb you baby
I seen it come together and I seen it crumble baby
Let them keep score, we just do our numbers baby
Everybody talkin', I feel like a trending topic
Hashtag, I bet your mouth bigger than your pocket
I got you and your bag, new Céline
Got you young fly, fuck what you mean
Let them groupies chat in the group chat
Niggas tryna shoot they shot but don't know where the hoops at
Bitch you know I'm ballin', if you smart, you would recruit that
Niggas catchin' plays, ask me where the alley-oops at

This burgundy colored slushie got me feelin' like the man of steel
Extreme Hyphy energy drink, spinning steering wheel
Mardi Gras beads around my neck, invisible set
Pull outs, diamonds in my mouth
Rally stripes, hustle cars, vans and campers
My dude got handlebars, get out your cameras
Wet the tar down, break out the crates
We on the soil ice skatin' doin Figure 8s
King of slang, they call me E-Bonics
I get stupid and dumb like Just Ice and Mantronix
Hear me out
The first mothafucka to even speak about a drought
40 a fool, I hear he growin' out his hair
You swear? Yeah he's takin' it there
This party music, get used to it
The Hyphy movement
Ay, pimp it's Ye, pimp
40 told me they fuck with me in the Bay, pimp
So I'mma ride down with the do's open
Yeah that's the way to get the hoes open
Yeah, high inch stilettos with the toes open
And any haters get they nose broken
Now tell me when to go, tell me where the hoes
She told me they was cold now you act like you don't know
Like ""ummmm, ummmm"", I'mma hit the liquor store
I'mma be on the low, I'mma have my hoodie on
If you call out my name then you know they gon' go
Dumb, you fuckin' up my mode, man
I told you only call me by my codename
They already recognize me from my gold chain

But I couldn't tell ya who decide wars

But homie this is my day, class started 2 hours ago
Oh am I late? No, I already graduated
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I'm cold, I'm cold, I'm cold
Yeah, yeah, yeah I got the right to put up a fight
But not quite 'cause you cut off my light
But my sight is better tonight and I might
See you in my nightmare, oh, how did you get there?
'Cause we were once a fairytale but this is farewell I got my life and it's my only one
I got the night, I'm running from the sun So goodnight, I made it out the door
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
So goodnight, I made it out the door After tonight there will be no return
After tonight I'm taking off on the road
I'm taking off on the road And that you know
Tell every one that you know
skrrt skrrt
And that's one thing that you know, that you know Okay, I'm back up on my grind
You do, you and I'm just gone do mine
You do you 'cause I'm just gone be fine Okay, I got you out my mind
The night is young, the drinks is cold
skrrt skrrt
You always thought I was always wrong Well, know you know
Tell everybody, everybody that you know
skrrt skrrt
And you like ""Man but I'm in these streets, I know what they want blah blah blah. Let me add this and I know we gone do better."" And then if you speak up too loud, you might get fired. You can't speak too loud and now I gotta be the poster child for what it means to break all boundaries. Cause I look in the inside of this TV, I look at all this matrix we in and I'm like ""Man ain't none of this real."" And the only thing real is your family, your loved ones, the time that you have. Only luxury is time and the only thing promised is that you gone die one day
This ain't no motherfucking Act III
This what happens when there's nothing on TV
Neo Anderson choices
Either be something bigger or just be unimportant
I chose my niggas with six figures and new Porsches
I'm off the Richter, you can't scale me. The flow gorgeous
Need seven figures and bad bitches to keep me focused
What you think I rap for? Definitely not a Ford Focus
I want the Jeep with the doors open
""And I don't wanna hear shit if it ain't me
All you niggas lack shit cause you ain't me""
That's my Grammy speech
My ""Gotta Keep It in the Family"" speech
Cause I made the flow and the beat
Wait
Billionaire LionGang Dreams, no need for rosters
Headphones on so I can't hear these impostors
This shit like a movie, need a motherfucking Oscar
I'd rather just let the music speak for itself. You know, it's like, I was happy to be in a situation where people couldn't say, oh, I was trying to promote my own song. For the times that I've, like, defended myself... [Tape break] I'm pushing the envelope! I wrote my fuckin' 'Run This Town' verse for a fuckin' month! When I heard Eminem's verse on the Drake shit, I went back and rewrote my shit for two days. I canceled appointments to rewrite! I fuckin' care! You know what I'm saying? And that's what I'm saying. Because I did that, Taylor Swift cannot win over Beyoncé! Because I wrote my verse in two days, Taylor Swift cannot beat Beyoncé. As long as I'm alive! And if I'm alive, kill me then! Kill me then! As long as I'm alive, you gon' have to deal with it. Cause there ain't gonna be no more motherfucking Elvises with no James Browns.
[A female voice asks, ""Why are you so angry? What's the anger?""] Because my mother got arrested for the fuckin' sit-ins. My mother died for this fame shit! I moved to fuckin' Hollywood chasing this shit. My mother died because of this shit. Fuck MTV.
How many of you people came here with someone you love tonight. If you love somebody tonight, hold on real tight. Hold on, hold on. If you love somebody tonight, hold on real tight. If you love somebody tonight, hold on, hold on. Hold on tonight
Tonight I was thinking about being as safe as possible, I don't want to say nothing politically incorrect. [???] A very safe musician. I've been thinking about it. I've been thinking about going backstage and not saying nothing at all, is that cool? Uhh, before I go back there I got to ask you one question. Just one real quick. Just one. CAN I TALK MY SHIT AGAIN? CAN I TALK MY SHIT AGAIN? Can I talk my shit? Can I talk my shit? It's like I always find, I always find, I always find something wrong. Cause I've been putting up with they shit just way too long. I'm so gifted at finding what they don't like the most. So if they find that they don't like the most
You know, it's so interesting cause they're trying to make me, like you just read the, Don't me ask about the motherfucking mask, you know what it comes off of. [?]. It's the Yeezus shit. You know when you, if you read the headlines and read like, random blogs or whatever the fuck they might put up, you know, it's funny how they, they always try to bring up the negative or, bring up the things that sound the most out of context. You know it's like, have you ever felt out of place ever, like, out of context like someone just didn't understand, like they just didn't understand what you wanted to do, what you was trying to do, or what, or what you was dreaming of. Have you ever, have you ever been scared to say, to say your dreams out loud? Have you ever been just a little bit afraid to say your dreams out loud? Have you been afraid to dream in front of a crowd, to dream in front of a crowd, to dream in front of a crowd, to dream out loud? 
I had a dream. I had a dream that I was Steve Jobs. I had a dream that I was Walt Disney. I had a dream that I was The Wright Brothers. I had a dream that I was Thomas Edison. I had a dream that I was Mandela. I had a dream that I was Martin Luther King. I had a dream, I had a dream, I had a dream. I had a dream, I had a dream. And I'm not afraid to dream out loud. You know you just get so scared that people are gonna think you're crazy, or that you're stupid, or that you're foolish, or this is the time that everybody thinks you're losing your mind, but I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind! I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind. So don't mind me, don't mind me, don't mind me. I'm not losing, I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind. So don't mind me, nevermind me, never, never, nevermind me. If what I'm saying, appeals to you, and makes you feel like you can be a better you, than thats good for me. And if what I'm saying offends you, and makes you feel like the worst you, than that's good for me too, true. That's good for me too, true. That's good for me too, true 
Cause there's only two types of people, there's dreamers and there's haters. There's dreamers and there's haters. And all I've been doing recently is cutting the grass real low. So if you a dreamer, everybody will know. And if you a hater, make yourself be seen, CAUSE I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOU, THATS WHAT I MEAN! Cut the grass real low, cut the grass real low, cut the grass real low. [?] I find [?], cause I feel like I just try sometimes. And I'm not afraid at all. I'm not afraid to fall. I'm not afraid to fall. I'm not afraid to fall. I'm not afraid at all. I'm not afraid at all. THEY CAN'T STAND ME! THEY CAN'T CONTROL ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME!!! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME!

Hey, we ain't gon stop

The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love
When they don't know one thing about
Instead they just runnin they mouths
So all we do is tune them out
I swear they got some nerve
Spreadin what they heard
I can't give them no burn
I can't be concerned with all that talk
I won't be involved
That's my word
See I'm not the one
They got me confused
They got me messed up
Don't you think I've had enough

[Pusha T - Chorus]
Doing my thing, pocket full of green
hand on my d-ck in my thousand dollar jeans
your girl a Queen, my girl a thing
you know what though? I'mma take, I'mma take this one for the team [Kanye West]
I'mma take this one for the team
GOOD music
yeah you know what
I figured out I'm not a nice guy
I shook hands, kissed babies gave it a nice try
you know what I hate pictures of other peoples kids
I hate plastic couches in other peoples cribs
I hate when other peoples crib's smell like sh-t
I hate when I leave, I smell like the crib
whats the cause of the poor smell?
she said ""I just cleaned up baby I can't tell""
why every ghetto b-tch gotta smell like Love Spell
or that God-damn cucumber bath and body works
I can still smell the sweat the sh-t hardly works
what about Cool Water that sh-t probably worse
is he a classic like the Ladi Dadi verse
and my man probably hollered at the hottie first
I score, he took the charge
ooooh, that sh-t gotta hurt [Pusha T - Chorus] [Pusha T]
Nevermind me, 'Ye have fun
if the cops ask, thats my gun
that's my weed, anything you need
I'mma take, I'mma take, I'mma take this one for the team
one fat ass, one flat ass
n-gga hit the switcheroo on my black ass
ever seen Joe's jeans on a jackass
and my b-tch got on tights with a tac ass
I'm a fly n-gga and I carry on
with the bottles of that Rose and Perignon
ever seen how a kingpin carry's on
dookie chain and a herringbone
real sh-t, gotta feel this
first class flights baby that's a field trip
double date don't cooperate, kill switch
f-ck me and my man, you a real b-tch [Chorus] [Kanye West]
Ladies and gentleman
it's G.O.O.D music in the house
and we got Keri [Keri Hilson]
All I know you the one that I heard about
know you work your way up through word of mouth
plus I'mma have to test you in and out
it's a dirty job but sometimes you gotta take it for the team
take it for the team
This is a story about uh ballers and players the same shit but uh
It's kinda like it's saying if you a true player you can't count that
skrrt skrrt
Sometimes you gottta take it as a loss player
That's right Consequence and uh I go by the name of uh Kanye to the

Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
skrrt skrrt
Man it feels good, everything is right
Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
My whole team winning, no vision on quitting
I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
Let 'em talk about it mane, I'm already living
I risk my life to try everyday to go and get it, get it, get it
Came from the bottom, no one said it would be fair
Now I'm on this money, lounging like it's a beach chair
Poppa don't preach, all we do is just reach here
Raised round killers, we just happy to be here
Spot 'em, got 'em, let your soul pay your dues
While my hoes doing magic, voodoo moulin rouge
That's a tactic that they use, fuck 'em high then suck 'em dry
Before you know it her Q7 is buzzing by
The queen pin to the king pin redeems him
The boat comes, the dope drums, my team wins
Yuugh! This the life that we made
Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade
[[Hook: Chris Brown]]

Supreme ballers, all my niggas got ESPYs
Triple doubles, both wrist and neck freeze

[Sway]: The most important artist of this generation. Over 21 Grammy's. 6 Consecutive number 1 albums. One of the most impactful voices to ever grab a microphone. One of the most talented producers to ever produce music, fashion, art. One of the most prolific people to ever speak on behalf of his thoughts; to trigger emotions and trigger thoughts of you. One of the most clever people to ever manipulate the internet. I watched him go from:
[Kanye West]: Sway you gotta hear my rhymes man you gotta hear my rhymes I know I make beats but you gotta hear my rhymes
[Sway] Being on the train, Amtrak train going to Philly, to now being mentioned alongside the President of the United States, more than once. We talk about President Obama, but you forgot some of the things that this man as said to really go against the grain and challenge thought fearlessly. For example:
[Kanye West]: George Bush doesn't care about black people
[Kanye West]: And another thing is, people are so gay-conscious now. That's like the whole thing like with the Internet — every day, somebody's- ""Ooh I can tell he gay now!"" you know, but back in the day, people used to have songs like ""Get In That Ass"" or something like that
[Kanye West]: Remind me who's the original superfly, and I got love for Hov but I ain't fucking with that Suit and Tie
[Sway]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome for the first time to Sway in the Morning here at Shade 45: the one, the only, the incomparable, Kanye West! [Sway]: What's is going to happen with the Red Octobers?
[Kanye West]: You know Nike told me when I asked them? ""We ain't sure."" You know what they told the store though, of my- of my boy that run the store? They said ""if you want that Red October, you gotta take these 10 other shoes."" So they told me, they ain't sure, but then they told them, if you want that Red October- but legally, we gotta both sign that contract, Mark Parker. I'mma put Mark Parker all on that Summer Jam screen. And by the way, Mark Parker, yes I will still accept an investment in Donda. I got some more ideas that don't involve shoes. But if you guys that're investing in the arts, y'all don't want to invest in the school in Brazil, y'all wanna go to Africa, I am standing up and I'm telling you, I am Warhol. I am the number one most impactful artist of our generation. I am Shakespeare in the flesh. Walt Disney. Nike. Google. Now who's gonna be the Medici family and stand up and let me create more; or do you wanna marginalize me 'til I'm out of my moment
[Sway]: But why don't you empower yourself and don't need them and do it yourself?
[Kanye West]: How Sway!
[Sway]: Take a few steps back, and-
[Kanye West (and Sway)]: You ain't got the answers man! You ain't got the answers! (Kanye) You ain't got the answers, Sway! (Kanye) I been doing this more than you! (Doing what more than me?) You ain't got- (C'mon, chill out, bro!) You ain't got the answers! (Kanye, relax!) You ain't got the answers! (Bro, rela- I'm asking you a question!) You ain't been doing the education. (Bro!) You ain't been doing the education! (Kanye, calm down!) You don't have the answers though. (Calm down!) Because you trying to give me advice about something- (No! No no no no, listen) You ain't- You ain't got the answers! You ain't spend 13 million dollars of your own money trying to empower yourself!
[Sway]: I know, and you're absolutely right, but I've spent hundreds and thousands putting out clothing line at a smaller degree
[Kanye West]: And that and that ain't Ralph though! It ain't Ralph level
[Sway]: Okay well let me ask you this--
I can make shit rhyme
I can make shit rhyme if I, feel like
And if I, don't. So I just might not, cause I, don't want
And i'm just gonna. Freestyle for the first time
With a freestyle, that don't
Even go together
Ough
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Mr. West is in the buildin'
Swagger on a hundred thousand trillion
Ayo, I know I got it first
I'm Christopher Columbus, y'all just the Pilgrims
Thanksgiving, do we even got a question?
Hermes pastel, I pass the dressing
My attitude is tattooed, that mean it's permanent
So I guess we should address it, huh?
My swagger is Mick Jagger
Every time I breathe on a track, I asthma attack it
""Why you so mad for? Why you gotta have it?""
‘Cause I slaved my whole life, now I'm the master
skrrt skrrt
How it feel to wake up and be the shit and the urine
skrrt skrrt
Tryin' to get that Kobe number, one over Jordan
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
(No one on the corner…) Got a bop like this
Can't wear skinny jeans, ‘cause my knots don't fit
No one on the corner got a pocket like this
So I rock Roc jeans, ‘cause my knots so thick
You can learn how to dress just by checkin' my fresh
Checkin', checkin' my fresh; checkin', checkin' my fresh
Follow my steps is the road to success
Where the niggas know you're thorough
When the girls say yes (yes)
But I can't teach you my swag
You can pay for school, but you can't buy class
School of hard knocks; I'm a grad
And that all-blue Yankee is my graduation cap
It's Hooooo-vahhhhh
Dippin' different Rovers, whippin' with the soda
Hooooo-vahhhhh
Did you even have any doubt after Doubt it was over?
skrrt skrrt
Nobody on the corner run circles 'round squares
Like my circle 'cause my circle run circles 'round theirs
Lions in my circle form circles 'round bears
'Cause we circle 'round blocks and knock circles out squares
skrrt skrrt
You bring your circle out where?
Where my circle at bitches form circles out there
Square biz, they just wanna see math
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
They got it all, they've got all the things I thought I wanted
But I can't afford to fake anymore to live this facade
And smile as the warm champagne pours
Out on the lawn, we'll pretend we're having
Tons of fun in this world where we don't belong
Some bloke all alone, is she thinking of me
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Just give me the chance to get it right, get it right
Oh, they got it all, you can see they got it all
They got the cars, the boat, and the beautiful house by the shore
And you know there's more, but I can't take another minute of it all
skrrt skrrt
He wants his breakfast in bed, he's got his trust fund saved
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
They got it all
They've got all the things I thought I wanted
But I can't afford
To fake anymore
To live this facade and smile as the warm champagne pours
Out on the lawn
We'll pretend we're having tonnes of fun in this world where we don't belong
Some bloke all alone
Is she thinking of me
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Oh they got it all you can see they got it all
They got the cars the boat and the beautiful house by the shore
And you know there's more
But I can't take another minute of it at all
skrrt skrrt
He wants his breakfast in bed
Yeah, G.O.O.D. Music
Starshell in the house
Let me see what the fuck you're about
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Want money like Jay, clothes like Ye
Chicks like Seal, mass appeal
I'm just tryin' to feel if the ass is real
Man I should've known since she from Brazil
South side, my nigga, give me room now
Money high, yeah my pockets on shrooms now
I had a lot of bullshit I had to tune out
It's me and dude now, what you gon' do now?
Cause if you mess with the spuds, then you gon' do the dishes
I ain't Flavor Flav, but you look delicious
And your heels vicious, killin' these bitches
I'm so sin-seriously pimpin!
Highlights and designer blues
With my tattoos of, ""I love you""
I just threw on these dancing shoes
To prove my love for you
skrrt skrrt
Secretly he notices how I'm playin' it up
For him, playin' it up
skrrt skrrt
Dancing on the tables as the DJ spinnin' it up
For me, spinnin' it up
Number one, so together I'm eleven
She's a ten, I'm number one, together we eleven
Her friend only a seven, sent her to 7-Eleven
She a ten, she a seven, that make 'em seventeen
Let me see your ID, only seventeen?
Eesh, that could have fucked up everythin'
Nike, already don't like me, always on a white tee
Dressed like I'm hypebeast, signed through my white tee
Dont race against the American dream
Together we like the Kenyan marathon team
Three black rap acts that spit that crack
Never pushed that 'Lac, rather push somethin' German
Lookin' for a Swedish bitch that I could put my sperm in
Preach, my brother, gon' start the sermon
All I see is green, call me Erick Sermon
Socks on concrete, jolly rancher kids
I was talking back and now I gotta stay at grandma's crib
Bunch of tank top, nappy headed bike-stealing Chatham boys
None of my niggas ain't had no dad
None of my niggas ain't have no choice
JJ, Mikey, Lil Derek and them
79th street was America then
Ice cream truck and the beauty supply
Blockbuster movies and Harold's again
We still catching lightning bugs
When the plague hit the backyard
Had to come in at dark cause the big shawtys act hard
Okay now, day camp at Grand Crossing
First day, nigga's shooting
Summer school get to losing students
But the CPD getting new recruitment
Our summer don't, our summer
Our summer don't get no shine no more
Our summer die, our summer time don't got no time no more
I love Hip-Hop and just turning the music up loud
And playing it the entire car ride
I always felt like I was uh
I don't know
Like I wasn't going to end up being a fine artist one day
The opportunity to put moving art against music
Was one of the best part's of being a professional recording artist

When the fast life takes its tole
That act right makes everything slow
Them black lights make everything glow
One of those nights where everything goes
Everybody goes through something
People be talking to you like you nothing
Then you be like bitch I'm me
Then your boss be like bitch then leave
You covered up your tats too long with them sleeves
You've gotta hit the club let the real you breathe
Would you believe, you'll never shine if you're not seen
So get all in they face like Noxzema
I know you mesmerized about that ass in them jeans
Please don't hit that raw, it's not clean
Please don't forget that all when it seems

Kid Cudi, don't ever mention Ye name! I birthed you. We out here dealing with that emo shit all the time. Me, Pat, Don C, don't never mention Ye name! Don't try to say who I can do songs with. You mad 'cos I'm doing songs with Drake. Ain't nobody telling Ye who to do songs with. Respect the god! Run it back Mike.

Me and your parents is cool. You know how many people wish they could be signed to G.O.O.D. Music, get their life changed? Had that opportunity? Never... forget that. I'm so hurt. I feel so disrespected.
This is a stream of consciousness… twitter poetry…
Lease see these next tweets as such because the ideas will jump around a bit… a bit like a mood board...
Up late designing in Sweden… 
Super inspired by my visit to Ikea today , really amazing company… my mind is racing with the possibilities… 
Playing the new Kendrick… 1 thousand images on the desktop… Hennessy & what's left of the ice and coke zero… 
Sitting with @Robinnowicki from @ustwo working on the YEEZY site… 
Really happy to get the quality of the products better at half the prices of last year… 
Bear with me guys, Rome wasn't built in a day but I promise to keep my promises… 
So proud of my brother @VirgilAbloh with his new @OffWht collection!!! 
Was speaking with @souljaian earlier about a new idea… 
Met with @Hermes_Paris family yesterday… been out here fighting for 13 years and it feels like we're finally seeing wins… 
Can't wait to get home to North, Saint and my wife… 
Sometimes the quiet moments feel like I'm home from battle…

Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
skrrt skrrt
Dance little brother, dont give up the fight
Hang on 'til tomorrow, the truth will come to light
Dance little sister, don't give up today
Hang on 'til tomorrow, tonight we celebrate, celebrate
Black bodies on the wall, color from years ago
It's spiritual the way that them tears they fell slow
Roots and bruises so deep, found it hard to sleep
Souls lost in the heat, pray to God to keep
Fast forward to my pop, he nod and geeked-off the Heron
Still he was dead to bear arms
Thats where I'm from, my story ain't that different from yours
A blood line, a hard time, prisons and wars
With struggle it came rain, when it rains it pours
We stayed between liquor stores, and ""praise the Lord""
Singing ""we shall overcome"" cause we came for more
We were dancing for it to rain no more
Though hurricanes and waves they came ashore
Takin' lives of the brave and poor
They'd ignore, us once again
But it was lessons in the wind
Of change that came from within
skrrt skrrt
Uhh, hell yea man, hm, oh fuck yeah
When I'm not at home beating my shit to death
I'm listening to The Madd Rapper's album
This is Ken Kaniff and I'm still mad as hell, fuck you
I'm crazy with this razor, with this razor I'm crazy
With this crazor I'm razy, razor crazed, I'm crazy
(Okay, I'm re-loaded) Go bring Jay Z
(Tell them him I'mma ghostwrite for him) on Dre's beats
Ran in the ladies' room naked in a blanket
At the banquet and started to spank it (ahh)
Came in the bank with a tank fired a blank at the clerk and handcuffed her ankles
To the safe and thanked her but I didn't take nothing (thanks)
Every bullet came from the same gun, just from different angles
Cause I was picking strange places to aim from
(Man, I bet you fifty bucks you won't jump out the window Shady)
*Crash* (Ahhhh!!) pay me
Psyche, no bread
Fucked up in the head
Shot my girl and my sister cause I caught them in bed
(Wait, wait, wait)
I'm a crazy motherfucker might shoot me a Fed
Or I just might start a fist fight instead
See as far as the dough go, I go loco
See me pumpin' gas at your local Sunoco
Stuck off the hydro, mixed with cocoa
Jump turn styles, then run from po-po
Life stinks, we don't give a fuck son, we crazy
Tear up the clubs and do drugs, we crazy
Fuck wild hoes and bust slugs, we crazy
Madd rapper is crazy
Slim Shady is crazy

Sayin' how you do it but they ain't did it, baby
You need a demonstration
This is how you get richer, baby
I'm stimulated
I'm at the bank, I'm penetratin'
I'm puttin' in, I'm penetratin'
I'm gettin' big, I'm stimulated
I touched a bitch, she disintegrated
Up in flames, I've been the flamest
I've been the hottest, you've been the lamest
I've been on the plane, you've been complainin'
Fuck the co-defendant, pistol whip the plaintiff
Hit the mall, then we skip arraignment
They say she young, I should've waited
She a big girl, dog when she stimulated
Hit Sin City and syndicate it
All the time on the strip in Vegas
I got the juice but I ain't Minute Maid it
But a nigga made it just minutes later
Shut the fuck and let me finish, baby
I'll let you finish later
skrrt skrrt
Yeah you book smart but don't be gettin' paper
Shootin' craps at The Wynn
Gettin' back to back wins
Made 20 bands playin' features
And I don't need a feature for this
Nigga I'm T-R-A, triple double
Every time I ball, man that's triple double
Tom Ford, Balmain, that's triple stuntin'
Tryna get a nut only gets you nothin'
So I don't give a fuck who these niggas datin'
Tsunami the Rollie, my wrist is flooded
How the fuck can these niggas hate it
When these bitches love it, man this shit is funny
All I can do is laugh, all I can do is laugh

As the sun sets
And the night falls
And them hoes call
He pulled up at 6:30 in a 745
As he waving ""Shorty, hi"", you know he showin' his bling out
She got in the car, he drove, he pulled his thing out
His girl caught feelings, she mad, she threw the ring out
How she found out she dreamt the whole thing out
Y'all be going through problems, you gotta work the kinks out
When you go to sleep? What do you think 'bout?
If y'all get a divorce
She gon' take everything except the kitchen sink out
Make it so cold that you gotta pull your mink out
Or grab your roller skates and turn a roller rink out
You now back up in the club, in the club, tryna min-gle
Meanwhile, she out doing the same thing now
Nightmares from your dream gal make you scream out

What she got is so Niagara
Make a young nigga straight need Viagra
Make a old nigga give keys to Jaguar
Just to keep from all the tease and laughter
Her telling her homegirls that he couldn't stay up
In the restaurant with her voice way up
Please keep it discreet
Keep the business out of the street
She said ""I would if he'll handle biz up in the sheets!""
Pop off like a thang thang
He keep keep
And every time that she bang bang
He skeet skeet
And he so bullheaded tried to three peat
Try imagining something passionate
Between you Cassie and Kim Kardashian
Maybe that'll work when you get to hit that ass again
Or you can grab a Red Bull and sip that twice
Now y'all can have sexy time, it's nice!!

Man this is classic
Call her National Geographic
You're kissing me and saying I'm the one you need
To keep you warm and lay with you tonight
Baby I feel the same way, I don't want to leave
Want to hold you close and feel your love inside
But I don't want to play myself
Because I know you're with someone else
And I don't need complications in my life
And I don't want to fall back in
And get caught up in you again
Boy I'm so conflicted in my mind
skrrt skrrt
You keep saying stay the night
Just let me rock you till the morning light
It's cold outside and much too late to drive
You know I need you baby, I'm so lost without your love
Obviously, procrastinating just to be
Close to you a little longer now
It's hard for me to break away from you baby
Never could resist you and I still haven't learned how
And I don't want to be a fool
But it's hard when it comes to you
And I'm feeling vulnerable tonight
Because I don't want to miss the chance
Of reliving our sweet romance
skrrt skrrt

Uh huh, where the money?
Uh huh, what, what
My whole squad in this bitch

Down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Weed, money, liquor
I'mma drown, drown, drown, drown, drown, drown, drown
Okay, I ain't that fucked up, but I'm halfway
We came a long way from the alley
Bad, bad, bad bitches they dressed up
Like it's the NBA draft day
And I bet and I bet that she ain't gon' be that late
For a young, sexy face like me
A young, young, young, sexy face like me
She like girls if she don't like me
And if you do then I do girl, I see ya, I see ya
The way that you pose I might have to IG ya

Hate just makes chop 'em as they creek, life forever sweet
Life's a gamble and I play for keeps in these streets, uh
Magnificant flow or magnifique, Rookie have a seat
Them lil nigga just my parakeets, smacking masterpiece
My life is good, my bitches bad
I'm switching pads, changing watches in my christmas bag
I got the gift of gab, talked my way in and took some ass
Whips and cash, come through half stepping and then get whipped in half
Southside's my heart, too hard to forget the past
Lost too many niggas to the dirt, keep the liquor stashed
My flows off the ropes, uppercuts, stick to jabs
Shorty wanna grab, catch a couple nuts, hit the cab
skrrt skrrt
And stash the weed in an altoid case
skrrt skrrt
What you gon do? It's G.O.O.D. Music and G-Unit
Ugh, Banks, Loso

Kick my way in and now I got the juice, Gucci bubble goose
Thousand kicks couple hundred boots getting fucking loot
skrrt skrrt

New Cody Chesnutt with my nuts on your chest bitch
She said “hey ‘Ye”
I said “Yes, bitch”
""Damn I'm only asking you a question""
I met this milf at the All-Star getting action
A cougar with more rings than Phil Jackson
Told her beauty is why God invented eyeballs
And her booty is why God invented my balls
I'm a rockstar, huh, start it up
Start it up, huh, start it up
So popular you should get a shot of us
Niggas don't take shots at us that is only obvious

But I just wanted to tell you guys: I really do believe that the world can be saved through design, and everything needs to actually be “architected.” And this is the reason why even some of the first DONDA employees were architects that started designing t-shirts instead of buildings. But just to see the work actually be actualized.
If I sit down and talk to Oprah for 2 hours, the conversation is about realization, self realization, and actually seeing your creativity happen in front of you. So the reason why I turn up so much in interviews is because I've tasted what it means to create and be able to impact, and affect in a positive way.

I go by the name of Kanye Tutter
the rock is in the building
and as far as I'm concern we about to bring that real soul back to the game
skrrt skrrt
let's go From what I hear Kanye is killing the game very bad
My girl rocking the little lamb that mary had
a little bit of dolsic style(?) makes the most it style
I'm versatile I'm the post it child
getting cheese so I'm suppose to smile (get it)
we makin hits like sosa now hit it
and i hate when girls acting boogie as hell
and I already seen them naked like lu kang trail
skrrt skrrt
do that mean god gone make my people stupid as hell
do that mean god gone make my kids be stupid as well
well, our father please forgive me
i'm sinner slash winner slash soul inventer It's so soulful Man
skrrt skrrt
so soulful man
and when you hear it is where it feels like soul food man It was so soulful Man
skrrt skrrt
It's so soulful man
and right here is where it feels like soul food man Look My mommy don't be playing, cause she know I got my game in tact
skrrt skrrt
and chickens know I'm gonna do it the way I'm gonna do it.
and miss communication no we never run into it
I got chicks like Simone and Cala
stay with lip gloss and fitty bag beside her
and your girl said you aint ready for me
I'm in love so mommy got me singing Tina Marie
How you bom in giovanni she in gucci and prada
chillin in a mirada studying like a scholar
so I don't even bother I be poppin my collar
[Tabs]
Can I get a soul clap
All my people can I get a soul clap
Up top y'all can I get a soul clap
And down low y'all can I get a soul clap
Yeah, can I get a soul clap
The path is long but this song is the road map
I never hold back when it comes to music
We've begun a movement, this is truth undisputed
Cults ?? uprooting the root of evil
The power is limitless so I'm giving it to the people
We came up through a crack in the street
They tryna keep us on our back but now we're back to our feet
They could never fathom the heights that we rose to
They try to block the road to the top but we broke through
There are so few of them gold rules that hold true
Take heed to what I told you, what I'm feeding you is soul food
Your eyes been blinded by the lies they sold you
I should let you keep fronting but that's something that I won't do
That's cuz I'm oldschool, way before protools
Before all these clowns became watered down like old dudes
We deep in the dark so we needing a spark
I'll fight for what is right cuz that's what I believe in my heart
But my heart is hurting, all my people are hardworking
I'm tryna pull you aboard the ark before them sharks start circling
Use our music to lean on after we gone
Cuz life's a game, a slow death and you don't get no restarts
So keep on keeping on until the pain stops
Sometimes to get to sunshine you gotta walk through raindrops
So take heed to the truth when it's told
It's what ya need, this is food for your soul
It keeps you warm as you troop through the cold
And helps you grab the wheel when you feel you losing control

That old fashioned word
It's a word called love
skrrt skrrt

Oh, this must be the way the nigga Pac felt when he made
Me Against the World, All Eyez on Me
Y'all niggas got me feeling like all eyes on me
Me against the world
Mmm, y'all got me on my shit
Thought niggas would appreciate what I did to this game
Being that I'm flesh of your flesh, blood of your blood
Come from the same hood you come from
We share basically the same stories
Thought niggas would appreciate what I came and did
Since ninety-six, every year
Something must be seriously wrong with the world
I know y'all ain't hating
skrrt skrrt
Don't tell me niggas is hating
skrrt skrrt
Nah, you know what I think
skrrt skrrt
(Some people lost their mind)
I think, I think y'all lost your mind
Y'all got me on my shit
Raw rough and rugged, when addressing the mass public
My attitude is fuck it cause motherfuckers love it
Got a chip on my shoulder the size of the Golden Nugget in Vegas
And fuck being famous, I came to get the butters
I came from the gutter, my success in this game
Is sort of like Pro-jectic Justice
A payment for brushes
With police officers
A peace offering
From the Gods for the streets I was tossed in
Til I'm deceased in a coffin
I'mma be a beast on these beats
Releasing early and often
Please, your disdain for the brothers ain't gon change the numbers
It's the strengthening of chain among us
Please we ain't afraid of none of ya's
Who want it with us
Ain't nuttin changed since the ninety-six summer, c'mon
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
(You know what I think?)
I think they lost their mind
(They say success breeds envy)
The problem is it ain't that I'm very good
It's that I'm scary good
Beats very hood, doin' numbers Mariah Carey would
Or in Hollywood doin' movies Jim Carrey would
Pardon, he's narcissist, we spittin' shit so arsonist
When I know the globe already warm before I spit
Woah, woah, woah, yeah, homie, that's the theme song
First I get my money right, then I get my team on
Yeah, DC
Stand up for your boy Ka Ree
I go by the name of Kanye To The
The Roc is in the building
And as far as I'm concerned, we about to bring that real soul back to the game
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
From what I hear Kanye is killing the game very bad
My girl rocking the little lamb that Mary had
A l ittle bit of Ghost's style mixed with Mos' style
I'm versatile I'm the poster child
Getting cheese so I'm suppose to smile, get it
We making hits like Sosa now, hit it
And I hate when girls acting bougie as hell
And I already seen them naked like Blu Cantrell
skrrt skrrt
Do that mean God gone make my kids be stupid as well?
Well, our father please forgive me
I'm sinner slash winner slash soul inventer
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
So soulful man
And when you hear it is where it feels like soul food man
It was so soulful man
skrrt skrrt
And right here is where it feels like soul food man
Look my Mommy don't be playing cause she know I got my game in tact
skrrt skrrt
And chickens know I'm gonna do it how I wanna do it
And miss communication, no we never run into it
skrrt skrrt

skrrt skrrt
(I'm tryin' to get to the top)
skrrt skrrt
(I just need some sorta direction baby you know what I'm sayin')
skrrt skrrt
(Yup, feel like I'm goin' in circles right now)
skrrt skrrt
(Lord help me)
skrrt skrrt
I'm feelin' like I'm losin' my mind, I'm walkin' blind
I'm just rollin' no destination no point or time
I'm lost, tryna find out which way is up
And get what I can get before my days is up
My life was rough, but fuck it shit it could've been worse
I'm free, when I could be in jail or a hearse
Most folks look at my lifestyle and say that I'm blessed
They see my smiles they don't see all the heartache and the stress
They don't see our hoes and foes pretend to be your friend
They love you and down for you 'til your cash flow in
When shit switch they split quick to treat you like a stranger
Then your hangin' like a hanger and give you the middle finger
Like you done somethin' wrong cause you don't provide 'em with drugs
Or do the shit you used to do like payday weigh in the club
I'mma show y'all some love if you don't love me
It's fair exchange or nothin' ain't no robberies
I'm so lost

Mom I made you a promise, it’s no more section 8
When we ate its the steaks, now our section is great
Cause that’s the level I’m at, my niggas pass em a plate
â€˜Ye!
(Break: Kanye West)
Why, why, why?
Why don’t they like me?
Cause Nike gave lot of niggas checks
But I’m the only nigga ever to check Nike
(Verse 2: Kanye West)
Richer than white people with black kids
Scarier than black people with ideas
Nobody can tell me where I’m headin’
But I feel like Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen at my wedding
They say I’m crazy but that’s the best thing going for me
You can’t lynch Marshawn, and Tom Brady throwin’ to me
I made a million mistakes, but I’m successful in spite of â€˜em
I believe you like a fat trainer takin’ a bite or somethin’
I wanna turn the tanks to playgrounds
I dream’t of 2Pac, he asked me â€œare you still down?â€
â€œYeah my niggaâ€, it’s on, it’s on, it’s on, it’s on
I know they told their white daughters don’t bring home Jerome
I am the free nigga archetype
I am the light and the beacon, you can ask the deacon
It’s funny when you get extra money
Every joke you tell just be extra funny
I mean you can even dress extra bummy
Cocaine, bathroom break, nose extra runny
And I gave you all I got, you still want extra from me
Oxford want a full blown lecture from me
And the Lexus pull up, err like hop, I hopped out, like wassup
Err-err-err, step back, hold up, my leg’ll be stuck
I studied the proportions, emotions runnin’ out of Autobahn
Speed level, had a drink with fear, and I was textin’ God
He said â€œI gave you a big dick, so go extra hardâ€
(Hook 2: Tyler, The Creator)

What a world that I'm living in
Will the rainstorms ever end?
Still I fell my path narrow I run again
See happiness is gone again
And then you see 'em
Grey clouds up above man
Metaphor to my life man
Still I fell my heart stronger then it's ever been
Strong will till my journey ends
'Til then I roll More then I've ever rolled
Not pills but the Mary, though
Still I feel my eyes heavy when the days go
Nothing helping with my head dose
But I ain't sleep Awake in another state
Living in a new space
Still fell my mind running at a steady pace
God help me so I'll win the race 'Til then I call

Leader: I've called this private meeting today because there is an imposter among us.
There is an imposter among us.
This brother right here has been out making beats on the side, yes he has.
Pretending he's broke walking amongst us.
This brother has been eating every day, can you believe that? Eating every day.
Pretending he's with us, he's not one of us.
I did not want to believe this, but I walked into the brother Kanye's closet and I found new shoes.

She love suckin' up cum

Flippin' at the Grammys with the Michael Jackson gloves
Outfit so crazy, prolly thought I was on drugs

That ox again sucking up all the oxygen from Earth
Givin' birth to phat styles so hide when I release my carbon dioxide
Detrimental to your health, tonic makes flesh bubble and boil
Fools quote in coils
So now they're strong on a power that's god
Lay in hardly any other can fathom
Watch me gather 'em up
In my congregation they'll be no hesitation
In my nation's reservation
That means I begin the mutating of a lyrical terror
All wack shit will get severed
Brain cells be in the process of amputation
All cerebral penetration must cease
I release a form of verbal death that by far
Will leave your whole mental scared
Sick thoughts on my mind x 7
With no self control
I have tendencies to make wack MCs' backbones break, bend
As my rap style ascends
We can rip limb from limb
Body parts get severed from my lyrical endeavors
We ain't all in this together
Because self-made get to top mountain peaks
While all you others stay weak
See it's survival of the fittest
So I rid dis fan of every hip-hop coal who ain't real
When punks try to get rid of me
Tak jest moi mili
MC Wojtu$ tu nadchodzi
Będzie rozpierdol, ostry rozkurw, aż do krańca moich godzin
Aż do końca moich dni, aż do końca twoich dni

Jestem Wojtu$, znasz mnie dobrze, zginiesz marnie, nawet w żłobie
Wjeżdżam w bita, daję słowo, Głodny Sukcesu, czekaj na to

Nie wyrobiłem się na Mikołaja, nie
Nie dałem rady w święta, nie
Ale 2K16 rozjebane w mik będzie
Najlepszy mixtape w polskim necie
Najlepszy raper, ziomuś we wszechświecie
Teraz refren, też zaśpiewam #Nate

With the people that I won't forget
Spending all the money that I just worked my ass off for
Doing things that I won't regret
I've been waiting way too long, long, long, long
Telling everybody that I know we about to be on, on, on, on
I ain't trying to look like I lied to these niggas
That I came up with, that's my team
Never would I let a woman come between
What we doing right now, this our dream
Wu-Tang Clan, niggas want that cream
I'm the Osiris to this shit right now

Welcome, to some shit that's considered legendary
I'm here to put the rap game in the cemetery
They told me it couldn't happen
""Ain't no way in hell you gon' make millions off of rapping""
But I'm just so determined
Catch me on the stage spitting verses like a sermon
You know I had to make 'em realize
Lights, camera, action, mofucker check the real in my eyes
Now they all looking so surprised
The dawn of a new era, like the sun I arise
Through these lyrics, I am immortalized
Strictly spitting the truth but the rest is telling more lies
This the type of shit most people fantasize
But this the shit I used to analyze
They told me I was too underground
So I took the mic out my basement and found another sound
I want it, I need it, I'm coming for the crown
Can't nobody stop me, I'm Rocky lets go another round

chorus: 
So many people get caught up in trying to remake their first album and it's impossible for me to make another College Dropout, but I could make the best Graduation and best 808's that I could make. And that's how you, I think, keep advancing as an artist. So few, you know, Hip Hop artists have ever advanced: their songs on their seventh, eight album sound exactly like the songs of their first album. More than a artist, I'm a real person and real people grow and I wanna just sing my growth

If you fall on the concrete thats your asphalt 
If you pass on that Kane beat, thats your last thought 
Get what you ask for i swear thats your ass thought 
She got a big booty but she couldnt drop that ass low 
So you take your last hoe and rope up all the cash flow 
When you getting money they be all up on your ass yo 
When you getting money cuts dont matter cus a nigger past go 
Straight to jail yo, in a hell hole 
Right next to lucifer, tell him i said hello 
Ask if imma be there soon, and tell him i said hell no. 
Yo what you say when your people get out of jail huh? 
(Beyonce) 
My niggers is home, i guess i got everything 
Everything i want, but i dont

No women in the crowd, screaming and its loud 
Doing things not allowed 
And i swear its going down right now 
I know one thing my momma would be proud 
And you see me looking up

Now beat that!
And your mother's saying ""Go to college""
So you finish college and it's wonderful
You feel so good
And after all the partying and craziness
And don't forget about that drug habit you picked up at school being around your peers
Hey!
Now you'll get that 25-thousand dollar job a year
And you'll spend all your money on crack cocaine
But, it'll be YOUR money
No more borrowing from mom for my high!
So now you get your degree tattooed on your back
Cause you're so excited about it
If you continue to work at the Gap, after several interviews, oh my God
You'll come in at a entry-level position
And if you do that
If you kiss enough ass
You'll move up to the next level

I'ma make sure these light skinned niggaz
Never ever never come back in style
Told 'em I finished school, and I started my own business
They say, 'Oh you graduated?'
No, I decided I was finished
Chasin' y'all dreams and what you've got planned
Now I spit it so hot you got tanned
Back to school and I hate it there, I hate it there
Everything I want I gotta wait a year, I wait a year
This nigga graduated at the top of my class..
I went to Cheesecake, he was a motherfucking waiter there
skrrt skrrt
Take ya'll back... to them school days, yeah
Fayettenam, what up, man?
We came a long way from stick and move
Niggas skipping school, just to scrap over bullshit
Nigga if you lose, it's a wrap, them hoes clowning
It goes down in the lunch room
I'm tryna spit this game nigga, fuck food
Bust moves to the hallway
My niggas posted on the wall, always
Ain't thinking about class, dog, my ass tryna parle
If we had this shit our way
We be standing here all day
But look the principal's coming, give pounds then we all escape,
All late to class with fake passes
Living life in the fast lane, but ain't passing
They dreaming, tryna be the next Jay-Z and Dame Dashes
I ain't even open my book and it's time to change classes
Walk straight past my ex and don't speak
It's all good, I'll probably have a new ex by next week
I just think, the shit we did was silly, yo, I know that
But what I wouldn't give to go back
Yea, Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Yea, I sit and wish I was a kid again
Yea I sit and wish
Yo, I walk another nigga girl to her class, with my hand on her ass
If he say 'what up' later, I just laugh
Real sneaky yo, gotta keep it low
Up in math, let my nigga read this real freaky note Kiki wrote, yea
Hooping up in P.E. you can't see me on this gym flo'
But damn Vanessa booty looking sick up in them gym shorts
Uh, we bag 'em up, ya'll niggas gonna have to wait
So they passing hate like, 'Damn I can't wait 'til they graduate.'
But some of my niggas will probably never make it
The S.A.T. shit man I doubt they ever take it, cause
Instead of tryna send a nigga to a tutor

The way I blew up on the scene you think Osama did it
The way I'm addressing DC you think Obama did it
This is for the ladies in the crowd, gettin' loud
My intelligent women, you dumb bitches ain't allowed
I'm reppin' DMV, so you know I'm proud
They gave me a license to kill and I'm doin' it right now
On the rise like DOW, with a Jones for this rap shit
At the ten headdin' for the zone watch me catch it
That VISA flow ‘cause I'm accepted everywhere
Getting credit now beware, I'm the tortoise you the hare
See I took my time to design this rhyme
Perfecting every synonym, every syllable slowly killin' them
Why spit game when I could just get to drillin' them
I think I'm going too fast, lets slow it down like Ritalin
GOOD Music, Yeezy
(I'm D'Banj)
If you ask me
Anybody who ain't tell you you was beautiful today need their ass beat
As we proceed, Island breeze, light the weed
I couldn't find the words on how I feel
But what I lacked in skill I made up for in real
Time, the most precious thing a man could give
Because what she givn' back is why that man can live
We need to take a break, minus the screech, oh
Find a resort, what? Private beach, Oooh
Pina colada sippin', by the sunset
My mission is to find every position, we ain't done yet
Take my heart, take my love
Take my body, come build my home 
Stay with me di Iyawo mi 
Cause you love me 
I will be your Scape goat honey
Cause you came through for me
You gave me break through baby (x2) 
Baby Boo I can see your eyes
Say you don jam many fools for your life
Them go come as lovers as them disguise
But as time goes by, na your body be the price 
Your back side sef...wey you carry na die
That's why sometimes I no dey surprise
Them go say them love you but that na lie
Chop and clean mouth, tell you bye bye 
And I'm just tryin' to play it cool
Wonderin' what you gon' do now
It's 11:15 and, baby, I got to hit you up
Are you playin' around? Oh, what now?
Tell me what's that's
12:35 and you sayin' that you ain't been to text
And that you're on your way, well, okay, okay
What I'm sayin', don't say it, don't say it
Now it's 1:15 and, baby, you got to be playin'
Baby, you have got to be playin'
Where are you?
Are you comin' back? Still callin' through
And she say she at the club with her girl
And it's her girl's birthday and she keepin' her there longer
And, uh, you know how that goes
And she want to see me so bad
Oh, so she's leavin' in about fifteen minutes
After this, uh, one favorite Pitbull song plays, goes off
Or some shit like that, now it's like, uh, 2:45
And you know what type of textses niggas send at that time
I texted her and I said, ""Are you alive?""
That's when you send that text
And you say, ""Hey, are you alive?""
Cause the only reason why you not here
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Now it's like 3:30 and you tell me that you're on your way
And a nigga so goddamn horny
You know what I said? ""Okay""
I'm just sayin', ""Okay""
Who you gon' listen to: Your ego or your dick?
Now the dick wins
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
And I can't understand, holdin' a white wine
BlackBerry in my hand
Lookin' at the time, 7 a.m
I can't believe this bitch sent me through this shit again
Oh, you got me, huh?
Are you gon' give me every chance you get?
You gon' give me every chance you get?
I don't know when you're gonna quit
Why would she make calls out the blue?

Why do I feel so alone?
Like everybody passing through the studio
Is in character as if we acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart to give these
Bitch niggas the cue to go
So they stick around kicking out feedback
And I entertain it as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back but
It's hard to think of them polite flows
When Stefano Pilati suits are your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full, now this shit just being lipo'd
Always said I'd say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets
Showing you the basics, I can't live and hold the camera
Someone gotta tape this
And make hits like a bitch that's married, I ain't miss24 hours from greatness, I'm that close
Don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South
Watchin' Hov's show
Embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarrassed
To pull my Phantom out
So I park about five houses down
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonder where my mind is, accounts in the minus
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus
Cause what I'm working with is timeless
And promoters try to get me out to they club
They say I have fun but I can't imagine how
Cause I just seen my ex-girl, standing with my next girl
[Produced by The Runners & Co]
A little trouble in the city
Trouble in my home
She told me love don't live here anymore
I wanna run to the light
It's too dark in this part of night
I need somebody who can make it right
And it's on tonight
skrrt skrrt
I can see you want it and so do i
skrrt skrrt
Let's save the night
All I ever wanted was my very own biography
Plus the dream chasing it had turned me to a deity
Groupies in the lobby they can't duck this dynasty
Oh God I take pleasure in this life and it's entirety
Niggas be hating the ol' Jay, they saying the new nigga nigga be crazy
But I've been fuckin so many bitches that my mistress might be your ol' lady
Took time to perfect in my heyday, disrespecting my work ethic lately
No homo but when Beyonce on stage no one seems to be noticing Jay-z
Lames complaining bout the state of the game
Real niggas hate it when no credit to names
There's a few million angels movin' around me
I just worship thee, for all he's done for me
It's a new day, I have been born again
I've been born again, I've been born again
In His spirit, and His name
I'm sanctified!
Lord I testify
He's right by my side
I believe it be
His word is so clear to me
skrrt skrrt
All I wanted was 100 million dollars and a bad bitch
Plus that paper chasin', it done turn me to a savage
Groupies in the lobby they just tryna get established
God, I've been guilty, fornicatin' from my status
Niggas be lovin' the old Ye, they sayin' the new Ye, that nigga be spazzin'
But when Ali turn up and be Ali, you can't ever take that nigga back to Cassius
So you can gon' and make them lies, but I'm so sanctified
I don't sweat it, wipe my forehead with a hankerchief
And wash my sins in the blood of Jesus
People sayin', ""Ye we need another Yeezus""
Lames try to tell me, ""Cut the wilin' out, out""
But who the fuck is you reachin'
Past me? 30 bottles champagne precession
That's that Holy water, sanctified refreshments
Trump Vote
I'll say something that is kinda politically correct
but I told y'all I didn't vote, right?
But if I would've voted, I would've voted on Trump.
Thank you—that's a woman right there, saying “I love you,” after I just said that there was things that I liked about Trump's campaign.
That's not supposed to happen, right? Case in point.
I guess we're just not gonna sell out the rest of the tour now.
There's nonpolitical methods to speaking that I like, that I feel were very futuristic. And that style, and that method of communication, has proven that it can beat a politically correct way of communication. And I fuck with that.
I don't say 2020 out of disrespect to our president, at all. I'm not saying that, ‘Oh man, that just mean that anybody can win.' That's not what I'm saying when I say 2020.
I just said, I got some ideas about the way we should connect our ideas. And we should use opposite parties that the Republicans, that the Democrats, that everyone that ran that had an idea that people agreed with, should be the collective ideas that are used to run the country. And that should mean more.
So there's things that Benjamin Carson believes in that I believe in. I think that Benjamin Carson should still be a consultant. I think that Hillary Clinton should still be a consultant. I think that Bill Clinton should still be a consultant. I think Obama should still be a consultant.
Instead, ‘Oh, I don't fuck with your principles, so now I'm not gonna give you no information that can help you help all of us.
I'm not saying this to diss celebrities at all, particularly on the democratic side—that's cool. I just hate the fact that because I'm a celebrity, everybody told me not to say that I loved the debates. I loved his approach. It be like, white people that's racist, running around saying nigga now.

[A fan throws something on Kanye's floating stage]
Ayy nigga, don't throw no shit while I'm talking
I am putting my career, my life, my public-well-standing
At risk when I talk to y'all like this
This is a moment in The Matrix, bro
[Kayne West:]
Stop it, stop it. Hey radio, fuck you! Radio, fuck you! Y'all don't want to lose again. A lot of people here tonight felt like they lost. You know why? Because y'all been lied to. Google lied to you. Facebook lied to you. Radio lied to you. Radio, fuck you! I know it's a lot of real niggas working at radio, real people, real programming directors with wives and kids that love music, that can't play what they want to play because they've been paid to play that bullshit over and over and over. And when I say that bullshit, what I'm saying is: we love Drake, Drake is great. He's a great artist. But Frank Ocean is great, too! But you know who the greatest of all of us? Who do y'all think?
[crowd shouts “Kanye” and other names]
Nope. Kid motherfucking Cudi.
Radio, fuck you! Oh yeah, I'm on my Trump shit tonight. Radio, fuck you. Yeah, I'm taking his lead. I'ma just say how I say, be ‘Ye, and win. I'ma take his lead. Radio, fuck you! Radio, fuck you! Wait a second. Eh, is it, “'Radio, fuck you?' That's what you're saying?” Exactly.
Not fuck the people that work at radio because these is real people that gotta feed they kids and they're not being allowed to play that real shit because they think that in order to feed they kids they gotta play the same shit over and over and over. I was raised by KRS 1, I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was raised by DMX. The last real nigga alive? Naw, nigga! We real niggas alive, we alive tonight, bruh! We alive tonight, bruh! Virgil Abloh is alive tonight, bro! A$AP Nast is alive tonight, bro! Bari is alive tonight, bro! Ian Connor is alive tonight, bro! Rocky alive tonight, bro! Aye, y'all love my show. When I say these names, y'all better scream for me. I don't give a fuck if you know the names or not! Go ahead, Google them. They will give you a little bit of factual information. They will give you that. Why did I name A$AP? Because that's the future. That's the niggas, they got me and Cudi. It's life.
We've got a hundred years out here, a hundred years on this planet, bro, and we can have a utopia! We can love each other! But the rules gotta be fair. Khaled and Drake and radio and Doc and 92.3 and everybody; is it just me, or did you hear that song so many times “you say you wanna play for free?” Aye, aye! You know what it is, though? Because, aye, I love Drake, I love Khaled. But they set that song up, bro.
And let me tell you something: MTV, fuck you! Once again, as always! I'm on my Trump shit tonight! Let me tell you what it is, bruh. Aye, you know me. I went down seven years of my life of motherfuckers hating me for saying Beyoncé had the best video. Hey, baby, let's rock and roll tonight. Y'all might be experiencing a lot of pop shit, but the vibes is back! The prodigal son, Kid Cudi, has returned! The vibes is back! I know it's going to be a lot of conversations after tonight!
Khaled, I know you got hitters from Miami. Please do not send them at my head. I just want to have a conversation about how we playing radio's game. Khaled, you a real nigga. Khaled, you a real nigga! You got the keys! But, as we learn all the politics that niggas was doing for years, Obama couldn't make America great because he couldn't be him to be who he was. Black men have been slaves. Obama wasn't allowed to do this - AAAH! - and still win! He had to be perfect. But being perfect don't always change shit, bro. Being perfect don't always change shit, bro!
So, when I talk about MTV, let me explain something: I was hurt. Beyoncé, I was hurt because I wanted to present a video called “Fade” and I don't expect MTV to help me. 'Mr. West, I don't respect you. I will let you know that Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for “Formation” over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.”' They told me beforehand so I wouldn't run on stage. Hey, bruh, y'all ain't gotta fuck with me, but you know I got the vision and you know I'ma gonna keep it real with you. Beyoncé, I was hurt! I went down seven years on behalf of your — hey, nigga, don't throw no shit while I'm talking! I am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk when I talk to y'all like this! This is a moment in the matrix, bro! The vibes is back! The vibes is back! Motherfuckers might feel a way about this tonight.

Checkin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch
I'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen
See I got a lot to say
And I ain't afraid to say it
Mind on money so it's why I'm tryin' to make it
Yeah, but the money's what you make it
Let it make you see where it's gon' take ya
Hey, you'll be headed nowhere
Moving so fast you won't even care
Yeah, but when you get there
What you gon' do when nobody's there?
Ay, I know what you're gonna say
Made it there alone so you don't worry 'bout they
Hey, but when it all goes away
You gonna be stuck so what I'm tryna say is
Don't lose your
Soul
Oh, Let go, let go of your ego
Don't lose your soul
Sail your soul
Sailing soul
Is it really worth it?
You are only hurting yourself
You will never grow if you lose control over yourself
(Don't let go)
If you don't get a hold of yourself
Then you will end up with no self
You're Playing the game for the fame in the end
But what do you gain when you're paying to win?
I am a pop artist. So my medium is public opinion and the world is my canvas
'I'm sorry' is something that you can use a lot. It gives you the opportunity to give your opinion, apologize for it, and give your opinion again. People say 'You shouldn't have to be sorry for your opinions ...' George Bush ... has some very cool self portraits. I didn't know he was an artist!
I felt my nerves a bit, and I don't feel that feeling a lot. The nerves of humility and modesty when being honored, a humanization of a reality of being recognized. And all I thought as I sat there [in the audience Monday], kind of shaking a little bit, is I need to get rid of that feeling, I need to not be nervous
This honor is going to make your lives easier, for two reasons: You don't have to defend me as much! And I'm going to make all of our lives easier. It is these Floyd Mayweather belts that are needed to prove what I have been saying my entire life – whether it was the sign of Paul McCartney grabbing me and saying, 'It's OK, he doesn't bite,' or the New York Times cover, or the Time (magazine) most-influential cover. And now a doctorate at the School of the Art institute of Chicago
Ayy stop, stop, stop, stop, stop it
Ayy, ayy radio, fuck you!

(Pom Pom Hurensohn!)
Lauf zu Mama, sonst erhältst du von der Faust von K-O-Doppel-L
'nen Schlag auf's Trommelfell
Du stehst vor'm Traualtar, gibst deiner Frau das Ja-Wort
Doch sie antwortet nicht, denn sie ist aufblasbar
Du bist neidisch auf mein' Schwanz
Motherfucker, was kann ich dafür?
Hab' ich ihn nur halb drin sagen Hoes, ich wirke distanziert
Ich besuche deine Stadt, bewaffnet mit 'nem Golfschläger
Und verursache mehr Kieferbrüche als ein Holzfäller
Deine Mom ist lustig, wenn ich zufällig vorbei komm'
Springt sie mir sofort an meine Eier, nenn' es Eisprung
Du hast Homies in der Jury und solltest du gewinnen
Dann höchstens durch Schiebung, so wie beim Sumoringen

See, I always find
And I always find
Visual, visual, JB
Yo, Ye, what up? Raekwon
You got stacks like the International House of Pancakes
All alone, ready to phone me and your hand shakes
Palms is wet, a don's regret
Never to walk miles for love, I sit in the starter's deck
It just happened I was floating, you seen the captain?
Blinked at me then I threw him my thinking cap
Take her, then we could slide to Jamaica
Shop for like a year or two, stop in Diego
It's obvious, I want to see who your mami is
We just friends so she can't Clyde, Bonnie this
Fly walls, dining in fly halls
Come to the master suite, leave every piece in the master hall
All my money tied in knots
Stand over there, that's why I make it happen on blocks
Brazil cut sweater, patent leather
Playing the field, trying to outslick Baretta
You see, my baby up and hit the road 
Where she's going? That's what nobody knows 
I need to find her before another man does 
I wouldn't want him to steal my love 
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber] 
I'm just tryna be cool, cool, cool, tryna be cool, what you expect me to do? 
I'm just tryna find, find, find this sweet love of mine 
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love? 
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up 
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough 
I won't stop until I find my runaway love 
Last name West and my teeth diamonds 
She said ""Yo what's your occupation, crazy rhyming?"" 
Listen to Wu-Tang, trying suits on 
Accoutrements is Grey Poupon 
Stunting in a high top Louis', shorts is the Coogis 
Runaway, did I make you runaway? Did I make you runaway?
How many people came with the one they love tonight?
You know love ain't always gon' be easy
Especially when people in your business like the way they do Yeezy
And ladies? I know you girls gon' be
Always talk 'bout what he did
Fellas? I know you guys
Always talk 'bout what she did
Y'all be going through up's and down's
Havin' fights and shit
I want you do a favor
First of all, just for the ladies
I just want you do me more favor
And y'all please now checking e-mails, cause I
Got it in the e-mails so guys get away with shit and some
I'm just serious, I'm just serious, I'm just serious
But for real 'bout tonight
If you love someone tonight hold onto'em real tight
If you love somebody tonight hold onto'em real tight, real tight, real tight

Lookin back with regeret cause I know
When you left, a part of me died slow
I kinda sorta feel defeated
I'm disappointed cause this missions incompleted
But, I can't believe that I'm free now
The noose's loose around my neck, I can breathe now
Cause, I would've told you go fuck yourself
You ain't care about shit, but yourself
Try to treat me like half a man
I should've fucked your best friend when I had the chance
Holy shit, this hoe's a trick
She tryna hit me up now like I owe her shit
Fuck that bitch, you can kiss my asshole
Because of you I am an asshole
Cause you always find, yes you always find
Bitch you always find something wrong
And i've been puttin up with your shit just way too long
Because of you
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most

Context needed to understand the film: Phoenix Symbolism Continual Explosion Context of Kanye's Past 
Scene 1: Dark Fantasy 
In the first few establishing shots of the film we see Mr West playing the character ""Griffin"" driving his car through the woods which come to play later in the film. A combination of hard colour correction filled with cinematic scenes of a meteor like object crashing down onto the planet through the clouds into Griffin's car making him crash.

S1, Part 4: The Crash

S1, Part 6: Television 
Dialogue Effects on the Audience 
Scene 2: Gorgeous 
She travels around Griffin's backyard spending time with the life around her even though the walls are trapped around her so she can't see outside. Studying each animal and learning her way around the garden before there is a abrupt cut into the next scene.

I gave Doug a grip and lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah, I'm talking 5 comma, 6 zeros, dot zero, here Doug
Back to running circles round niggas
Now we squared up, hold up
Life's a game, but it's not fair

Walking tall against the rain
Victory's within the mile
Almost there, don't give up now

I...smile...when Rosie comes to see me
And I'm sad when Rosie goes away
Cuz, Rosie brings the sunshine
I...smile...cuz Rosie let's me be me
Love grows with Rosie every day
Cuz Rosie brings the sunshine
And I'm in love with Rosie
I know it's past visiting hours
But can I please give her these flowers?
The doctor don't wanna take procedures
He claim my heart can't take the anaesthesia
It'll send her body into a seizure
That lil' thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepin
Hey chick, I'm at a loss for words
What do you say at this time? Remember when I was 9?
Tell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin'
Her family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'
I'm arguin like what kind of doctor can we fly in
You know the best medicine go to people that's paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
And all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandma's in the NBA
Right now she'd be okay? But since she
Was just a secretary, worked for the church for 35 years
Things 'sposed to stop right here
My grandfather tryin to pull it together, he's strong
That's where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse ""Did you do the research?""
She asked me, ""Can you sign some t-shirts?""
Bitch, is you smokin reefer?
You don't see that we hurt? But still
I, smile, when roses come to see me
And I, can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break
They outside of the emergency room
You can feel my heartbeat, beat, beat
If she gon' pull through, we gon' find out soon
But right now she asleep, sleep, sleep
My momma say they say she could pass away any day
Hey chick, what these doctors know anyway?
From that one twelve to
That two twenty four
To that four forty eight
Watch a player get straight
Got that Rosanne
Cause a player got weight
Call me Lieutenant Dan
Cause I got that Rosanne
Started with that 28
Moved it up to 56
Buck 50 crocodile hunter out here taking risks
I saw the video for Promise just like 50 Cent
Now I wanna hit Ciera just like 50 Cent
Call me Tom Cruise I'm on risky biz
Pulling hoes buying clothes And taking risks
Hit the Swaporama to get my ruler kit
Got another one from folks cause he wasn't using it
We was wearing Coogi the first time around
Now you wearing Coogi only cause the price come down
I got the Spizzikes you got the replicas
We up several flights please don't try to step with us
And we keep that pot call it Harry Potter
And we wearing minks you wearing a hairy otter
A German Shepard a sheared possum
I'm Batman you in Gotham
And we up them things not no boomerangs
And we talk our own language just like
Pooty Tang tippy tow why you tripping now
At first it was a drought but now the block is tipping now
The conman, aw, damn, we back in town, word

skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Damn, you back from your trip
I thought the plane would have helped you over
Stop sellin' crack out the crib, yeah, when hell freeze over
Until the (?) over, hard to fly wings over
Dog, you talkin' way too fast, tell me it slower
You seen my boys is over, (?) wasn't right
Cause my feet is on the sofa and I never fill up the (?)
A man (?), dog, I ain't got my half
But if you buy me this, ma, I promise I'll pay you back
But the way you act, I be really want to see you dead
Plus it's four hundred missin' from under my bed
They put me in arrest and have you beat them 'bout the iron
When them niggas rushed the crib
I was the one that poured the ice in them
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
We have, we have in this corner the dead heat roommate
Fresh from his momma crib
He embossed the market thanks to my sponsorship
I ain't finna argue 'bout what we finna watch, dog
We finna watch Fox and the weed finna (?)
I can't even bring hoes to my spot
You be tryin' to thug 'em out, roommate version of Pac
When it's not grievin' when I ask where you'd be
You told me like (?), he beat the shit out of me
Will I ever change in this life?
My grandma said I'll never change and she right
Y'all think that L.A. gang banging shit hype?
Well you finna' find out what the game be like
Red rag on my rear view
No tint in the Porsche, see clear through
God screaming up out them speakers
So loud that a nigga can't hear you
Wake up to a diamond cross, I'm a Christian
Got a nigga feeling like Obama 'nem
Niggas shot out my windows, they jealous and envy
They spit on my 'Rari, they keyed up my Bentley
They went at my top dog like Ab-Soul and Kendrick
I said I'm a killa', god damn it I meant it
I said I sold crack, nigga bubbling skillets
At my grandma's house, I was selling work in it
And god bless her soul, she died
Back out the four, load up the five
Pop up the trunk, load up them pies
Aye 'Ye, ain't this how them niggas do it in the Chi?
Vice Lords, GD's
Crips, Bloods and Impala's on gold D's
Yesterday a nigga swore he was a man in the hood
Now he begging for his life on both knees
I'm a killer, no codees
Ask 40 Glocc, niggas don't know me
Got a problem blood, then come show me
I'm on Rosecrans ing them Kobe's
Got diamonds off in my Rollie
Granddaddy stuffed in my stogie
Motherfuck them Axel Foleys
Where I'm from, niggas shooting at the police
Man these fuck niggas got me screwed up
I'm like Papa Smurf in that blue truck
Red hat, red pants
Walking inside dreams with the kush in my hand - I'm
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' them drugs up
Young nigga 15, broke, livin' the scene
Sawed off in my pants, ‘bout to go make the lean
Finna' rob me a nigga who's money wasn't the same
Somebody gon' give it to me, or get one up in the brain
Mama used to stroke it just to feed me scraps
Every Saturday, it was YO! MTV raps
Got sick of looking at other niggas that ain't deserve it
So I followed my older brother to beat these traps
I ain't worried about the love, I've seen everything
The hood hot, like the devil had it off in his hands
Send a strap your way, I seen a couple of fans
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
How she order all that food and a motherfucking Diet Coke?
He said ""You lying yo, why is you lying Joe?
Cut it out, quit it G, you hurting my kid-i-neys.""
Naw, she talking bout a couple of kids for me
She's hinting at a ring from Tiffany's
skrrt skrrt
I swear since that day I've been treating fat girls differently
She told me if you read music you a genius
I don't play but I'll introduce you to my pianist
She said you need a little ice just to keep me cool
No dimes but baby here go the family jewels
I'm tight with my doe like my family Jews
Uh! I said ""Jews"" my career is screwed
I ain't mean in the Hanukkah sense of the word
I realize it's a sensitive word
Plus a lot of best friends is white
I mean ah, I mean my Air 1's, my diamonds and my Benz is white
And I ain't one of them producers that pretend to write
Ayo, Teefa, uh why don't you come on grab the mic

Coming at me and girls talking 'bout a men-a-

Franchise, Crosby, American dream
All-star point guard, third year in the lead
First round, number-two pick, the heart of the team
I done set and watch 'em jump off the screen
I done seen and shaken [?] shoes
Fake baseline, [still and step and pull up a tomb??]
It's the franchise, I'll leave a tooth in the game
Boy comes straight out of D.C. doing his thing
The terrapin off in Maryland, chocolate leaves
So [I'll pertain they're 'bout to drop him a sleeve??]
(Big Gipp)
You'se a baffoon, caught up in your own cocoon
Leave your head rest maroon
Drunk heavy in the side street saloon
Til' I figured it out, to the 3rd degree
I'm the milli in the meter
I'm the gram up in the kilo
I'm the wave up in the ocean
The C up in the coast and
The B up in the Boston
So what you looking for or looking at now
You ain't got what you gotta shake
Caught it on the sidewalk fake
I gets down, further digging down
Hurt for the red dirt at the same time
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
My old hood could use a little rebuilding
A better place for these ghetto children
I ain't gonna let 'em take the O out my JOY
Before you can rebuild, you've got to destroy
And these walls gonna come tumbling down
These walls gonna come tumbling down
(Cee-Lo)
Well I remember when, I was slanging nothing but weed
I ain't ??? round here that can't tell you about me
Fortunately I done changed the way I used to be
When so many didn't have an alternative to see
Music saved my life and now I'll never forget it
Thats why I try to glorify God with it
But it still remains, its in my veins
I know that I'mma sin, I just hope he'll forgive me again
Okay, I'm right and wrong in the same day
And it's always gonna be someone who'll see it the same way
And if I react, who was that guy to blame, hey
You fuck with me, I fuck with you thats how the game played
I had a choice to let it go, but if you don't let it go
[RALI: Verse 1]
You ever felt like every time that you get up out seat, people watching you?
Think they hate your guts, but they never even talked to you?
Seen who you used to be? Know who you became?
You're feeling close to fame, but you're so far away
Look in the sky, like a scientist; blind as shit
Searching for the answers to my questions, hope I find them quick
Why is it? Everywhere I go, I gotta pay a different toll
For every debt that I acquire, with a fine tip pen
And a light skin girl, with some nice lips
Thick ass, nice hips, slim waist, cute face, nice tits
Mean walk; thinking she a queen, but the shit ain't what it seem
So she try to hold on to nigga, like some vise-grips?
But still, I eat the shit that's on my plate
Niggas really love me, but in public, they just love to hate;
Behind closed doors - same dudes same pressing play on my shit
Tryna ride on my dick
So I just tell them dudes
They can get up off my dick, before they get pregnant
Cause these niggas love to talk, then they switch subject
Like, ""Did you hear that nigga Sheed? I heard he weak.""
Faking like they hit delete, while them niggas hit repeat
See, wolves run in packs, and bitches run in fleets
What them bitches don't know, have them jumping out they seats
I guess their thinking in the back of their mind, I shouldn't be able to fly:
Aerodynamics of Bee Flight
So they just hate me when they see flight
Gritting their teeth like, it's a piece of meat stuck in their teeth
I branched out; these niggas been leaf-like; wreath-like
Seasonal, feasible, meat sliced
But I'm rare like a over-done ham, in a mosque in Arabia
God's in the making here, and I ain't gotta fake it
If I'm lying, let God strike me down while I'm saying this
I'm probably the most intelligent mind in your radius
Never been babied
Never been baby-ish
Got up on my grown man
Niggas acting lady-ish
Broke down, thought that I would drown
Hope that I've been found, 'fore I hit the ground
Some days out the corner of my eye, hey
Saw you weeping, saw you creeping
Saw you sneaking in the shadow's long
The fear so strong
Saw you out the corner of my eye
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I'mma savor it
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I remember when
(Reaper)
You came to take me away
So close I was to heaven's gates
skrrt skrrt
Oh, you tried to track me down
You followed me like the darkest cloud
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
So come back when I'm good and old
Yeah, yeah, you know how me and 'Ye do
Real People walk in the streets, the streets is talkin'
Often it's beef this city never does
People walk and talk in they sleep
Cold sweats and wet dreams
On how to get green our faith is all in a jeep
Black souls raw and they deep
Hypes tryna talk with no teeth
Shorties sayin' ball or retreat
A lesson we all speak at one point or another
What you expect from one who smoke a joint with his mother
Anointed hustlers in a fatherless region
Through the pain wish they know that God was just teachin'
We want decent homes
So dreams we say out loud like speakerphones just to keep em on
It's like a colored song that keep keepin' on
I guess knowin' I'm weak is when I'm really bein' strong
Somehow through the dust I could see the dawn
Like the Bishop Magic Juan, that's why I write freedom songs
For the real people
I wonder is the spirits of Bob Marley and Haile Selassie
Watch me as the cops be tryna and pop and lock me
They cocky, plus they mentality is Nazi
The way they treat blacks I wanna snap like paparazzi
We're the children of a better God searchin' for better jobs
We could cop ghetto cars tryin' not to catch a charge
They say the dope game is sour
Rell and this is Roc-A-Fella music
Crack-i-lackin', stand up
Yeah yeah my baby yeah
Now if love could ever have a flavor
Then it'll taste just like you
And if ever I was able
There's no limit to what I'll do (what I'll do)
So graceful when you walk (graceful when you walk)
Curvaceous in all the right places
I promise if we talk (promise if we talk)
Gonna know that I've been the one that you've been waiting for
So baby come get this real love, you'll see
I know just what you need
Now what is this I done run into (I done run into)
A strawberry wrapped up in chocolate
And from the way her body moves (way her body moves)
I can tell that we would have the bombest sex
But you gotta understand (gotta understand) girl
That it's all up to you (it's all up to you)
Cause I'm a perfect gentlemen, yeah (perfect gentlemen)
When it comes to the way I do
You'll gonna love the way I do baby think it through
Thinkin' back to when I had a dream, live like king and queen
As you see, we're far from that but notice that I'm pristine
I'm kidding, wishing I could flee from this fucking scene
I don't got G's riding with me like I'm almost dead and bleeding
Worries me, honestly, I wish I knew what I'll be
When I'm growing up, 33, can you see me alive and breathing?
Sanity's become my fantasy, wearing off like it's vanity
Jumping up and down like I just discovered gravity
Got a messy ass family and I love 'em but I'm maddened
By the worries that I'm facing, I see 'em, laughing me
Out of the building, looking like a thousand children
With their parents, only women, I'm in Paris fucking Hilton, yeah
That's a reference to somebody that fell off the radar
Gonna happen to me soon, I'm red and blue, Darth Vader
Don't question when you bend the truth, oh, you're busy later?
Oh, what a coincidence, a year ago, you weren't a hater
But now, look at you, girl, I'm so proud
Over 23 and you are tryna call me out
I'm only 18 and my future's looking bleak
You could have joined me on this journey but you went and fucked with me
And I don't hate you, oh, you should know that
I never played you like you were a throwback
To a time, I felt alive, now it makes me cry
I miss it, man and now I'm hoping that I fucking die
Introduction:
Real friends, take to the skies my nigga. Von Poe VII, Organized Threat, we back up in this bitch. Better believe that, my real friends
[Lead In]
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Stuck to the mission
And how many bitchin
They tell you they loyal
My real friends
Not as loyal as you is
My momma always tried to tell the young god
At the most you're counting two hands and
Most of the people in your circle ain't your family
My uncle that's the OG
My brother that's the better me
See fake friends or snakes in the garden
Before they get to me
How many years you wasted on them
Tragedy stricken
When was the last time
You seen Poetic Death in the building
I heard the word is
Them niggas said I ran for cover
Was ducking mothafuckas in the streets
Like I was Danny Glover
Lethal Weapon metaphor tactics
I flip it backwards
Them niggas had me fucked up
I was happy with their loyalty
But twenty-thirteen revealed a lot to me
I went from beefing with some niggas
To watch my homies chill with enemies
Now ask me if I trust them
Baby, fuck em
Them real friends
There ain't too many in abundance
I keep my circle tighter
Than the piece of puss I'm fuckin on
Now-a-days I'm paranoid
And now-a-days I'm bustin
And no we're not rebuilding
And I am not your crutches
And I could give a fuck
About any future discussions
How I'm feeling
My ex-girl wanted more from me
Than I could ever really give to her
I've had niggas leave the Threat
Cause I'm refusing to shoot their videos
That free of charge
Cause niggas never paid me for shit
Plus I ain't never signed them
Or received a royalty check
Now that's a real friend
But now I got the phone on silence
Like I should disappear from all of them
Just to start a riot
I should disappear from all of them
But knowing that they don't give a fuck
Got me going that much harder
I'm destined to be a problem
I took you niggas out of the hood dawg
A real friend
I guess I get what I deserve don't I?
Real friends, how many of us?
How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
It's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up, I'm drinkin' at the communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you're not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?
Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even when we was young I used to make time
Now we be way too busy just to make time
Even for my...
Real friends

Couldn't tell you how old your son is
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg
Plus I already got one kid
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though
I just showed up for the yams though
Its real easy, yeah
Yeah it's easy to be wack, its way harder to give your heart and soul, it ain't easy to get it back
Like a chain that you bling, it was easy to get it snatched
Your friends was easy targets and you easy with the scratch
Them hoes was easier to fuck, so you easily attached
You was easy with the car keys, and easily was jacked
When the pussy way too easy, its so easy to get laxed
Everybody eavesdropping, so you easily get taxed
'cus they know you got it
When you easy-going everything comes out of pocket
Once you start easing up, it ain't easy to stop it
Talking anything but favors make easier topics
When you was ballin' for yourself it was easier shopping
Now everybody want something, and ain't easily coppin'
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Waiting on a dream
That'll never come true
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt

Hov
I ain't done...

Real niggas respect it, fake niggas want beef
Raf Simons is the future. Still the future. The 40-year-old Belgian designer has long been the headlight for radical menswear. Throughout the '90s and '00s, his eponymous label showed how innovative design can embrace new technologies and fabrics and rethink traditional structures. In 2005, Simons turned from rogue independent to the man behind a megabrand, taking the reins of the men's and women's lines at Jil Sander. That label has always been known for its clean, utilitarian silhouettes, a precision that seems to particularly suit Simons, who, for the Fall 2008 womenswear collection, put the tailors on the dresses and the dressmakers on the tailoring. It was Simons way of again unsettling how we think of clothes
Simons has many fans well beyond the closed doors of high fashion. Take Kanye West, the hip-hop superstar who has pretty much restyled the music world over the past few years. He's never hidden his interest in fashion. When West went looking for inspiration in developing his upcoming sportswear line, Pastelle, he had the good sense to check out Simons. Their upbringings couldn't have been more different, but Simons and West are both fearless individualists. Here they talk about style, music, and why it's good to be the outsider on the playground. We started off asking them what they were like as children
RAF SIMONS: I was born in this very small village in Belgium. It wasn't really a creative environment. In school, creating was kept away from young people. The village was so small there was no outlet except for one little record store. I think that is where it started for me-just picking up records. I'm 40 years old, so it was LPs. The first LP I ever bought—you're going to be shocked—was Bob Marley. Then I switched to Kraftwerk, Joy Division, and that kind of stuff. I was a bit dark at that time because I felt so isolated. But not only me, there were some other young people who felt that way. We loved to dress in black. I was growing up in the New Wave period, but that wasn't allowed in school. I remember moments when they wouldn't let four people dressed in black stand together on the playground. Then, before I graduated, I remember finding this book, and there was one page about industrial design. Basically, I ended up going to school for that. At that time there was a big boom going on with fashion in Belgium. The more I looked, the more I became interested. Before that I never even thought to become a fashion designer or anything like that. I started feeling that work when I was 19 years old, but I didn't do my first collection until I was 27. I wanted to finish my education in industrial design first. My parents are very holy to me. They never said, ""You should do this,"" or ""You should do that."" My dad had to go in the army when he was 16, and he stayed there. My mom was a cleaning lady her whole life. The only thing they said to me was: ""Take it seriously. Do what you what you believe in, but take it seriously."" So the fourth year, I had to go for an internship. I went to Walter Van Beirendonck. I knocked on his door, and I was super scared-because I had nothing to do with fashion. But he was interested. He had absolutely zero interest in all of the fashion work I had faked to impress him. He just went straight to my industrial-design stuff. He said, ""I really want you to come because, next to the fact that I am a fashion designer, I have this presentation in Paris and objects to make. I'm not a traditional designer."" I ended up doing that with him, and he took me to Paris, and I saw my first show, which was the third show for Martin Margiela. Nothing else in fashion has had such a big impact on me. It was a show where half the audience cried, including myself. I was just like, ""What! This is fashion?"" Only at that point did I understand what fashion could be or what it could mean to people. It was the ""white"" show, where all the models wore dresses in white and transparent plastic. Margiela had no money at the time, so the Maison ended up going to a black neighborhood in Paris and asking if they could use a children's playground for the show. The parents said, ""Yes, you can have the playground, but we want our children to be able to see it."" So little black children were standing with the audience in the front row. The children started to run over to the models, and they picked them up and held them around their necks
KANYE WEST: For me, I realized the psychology behind having Jordans growing up—what it meant culturally, or what it meant to be a child just trying to fit in. When my parents divorced, my mother moved to Chicago, and my father stayed in Maryland. My mother lived in an all-black neighborhood. My father lived in an all-white neighborhood. When I got to Maryland, I had to adjust to a more affluent neighborhood than what I was used to in Chicago. Then when I went back to Chicago, I had to readjust to that. Then my mother and I moved to China for a year when I was in fifth grade. I had to adjust to a place where there was nobody my age, not to mention any black kids out there. Those were scary situations, but it made me able to open up my mind to other cultures and be accepting. And that is the greatest blessing, to have those experiences, because I can adapt to other cultures and still be who I am. So you see, with my style, there is a bit of Paris and a bit of Japan and a bit of the suburbs. A lot of people's style looks very specific to one region
RS: That's very good. Having your feet in the middle, you can see everything very differently. I think it's beyond fantastic, actually. Dress codes and gestures and attitudes have always inspired me, as has youth culture in general, although now I question it more. If you analyze youth cultures over history, there has always been something strict about them-you have to be like this or like that. I'm actually surprised that in the 21st century, it can still be so present: They are still environments with walls around them
KW: What I've noticed in the last few months, especially since my mom passed, is that everything is a cult. I don't mean cult in a bad way, just that everything's been cultivated for us. New ideas are the new roads, the dirt roads, that people have to pave. In order to go through the dirt roads, you have to get scratched with sticks, and you end up dirty if you have any new concepts. America is made not to have new concepts. It's there to live alongside strip malls and be beaten by mundaneness. Even hip-hop is: ""You can't do this, you can't say that. These are the rules of hip-hop."" One of my friends, Ludacris, wanted me to make a song called ""Did It for Hip-Hop."" On the song I was gonna talk about how I didn't do anything for hip-hop-I did it for myself. I did subscribe to the cult of hip-hop at one point, and I am very hip-hop because of it. But I have a lot of ideas that extend way further than the rules of hip-hop. In Japan you see guys that are dressed completely hip-hop, but they're completely nice also. They'll come up to you, looking like they'll rob you and instead they bow. I find a lot of similarities between myself and the Japanese, because sometimes they look at something from the outside, and take the best of what they like about it, and then they'll work extremely hard at pushing it to another level. They'll take a piece of Americana, like jeans, buy all the jean mills, and then be the master at those jeans. From a music standpoint, I stayed in Chicago, where there's no music industry, no outlets, nobody else that can make beats with me, not on the level of New York. Whereas in New York, everyone knew one another-you could be a small producer and sell a beat really quickly. So I would work on the beat so much that by the time I got to New York, the ones I was making were way better than anyone else's. They were like, ""Damn! Your beats sound like they're completed songs!"" Cause people would just do beats that were a sample, like a really basic idea. Then they'd have a keyboard player come in, a person who's a specialist at drums, and an engineer. And I'm doing all this in my room, right next to my mother, trying to beat five producers, taking the entire summer off, not getting a haircut, not getting any new shoes, cause I couldn't afford them—and it's like what Japanese people do: They see it and they end up doing it way better than the culture that made it. You once told me that if you didn't do fashion, you would have done psychology
RS: I like to find out things about people. I'm interested in them. But part of being a psychiatrist is also having to find out about people you don't have an interest in
KW: Right. That's the problem. Whenever you take a job that you think you're gonna love, there's gonna be situations like that, where you also have to work with people who you're not as interested in, until you get to the point where you're at the very top of your game and you can just be like, ""No, I don't want to do this at all."" Until then, you haven't reached your ultimate goal in life—a lot of people don't realize that the ultimate goal in life is to not have to do anything you don't want to do. Most people think the solution is to make a lot of money. The only problem is some people fall into the trap where money becomes the prison, and they end up having to do a bunch of things that they don't want to do for money to get that couple weeks of vacation where they feel like they're not doing anything they don't want to do. So, for me, I try to design my life like it's a big vacation every single day, every moment of my life. That's the goal. Like, I wouldn't rather be doing anything more right now than talking on the phone with Raf Simons, one of my idols and someone I've studied so much. I was in a Jil Sander store for an hour yesterday, looking at the collars and studying the way the marble print was put on the sweaters
RS: That means a lot to me, and that's also why I continue to do what I do. For me, I think that the 21st century almost doesn't allow the beauty of something really small and out of the spotlight. I deal now with two labels, my own, which is a very small label, and Jil, which is a very big, corporate business label. I see the difference, and every day I work there I think, What is now best for me?—because I like both very much. My own mentality is to make it small, like my own environment. In that sense I relate to what you were saying because I enjoy just working with my people every day. But our society doesn't allow that. Our society wants things to grow, and our society wants things to become bigger and bigger. Everything has to be put under the spotlight
KW: Where I came from in Chicago, we didn't have the term hip-hop. People didn't even know how to state the way I dressed or acted and what my mannerisms were. It's like how you said there were only a few people who dressed in black. I can't even think of one person in my school who dressed like me. There are new boxes and barriers that I'm breaking down every day. Coming from the hip-hop community, one of the things that you're never allowed to do is to speak about gay people unless you're disrespecting them. You couldn't be friends with gay people, you couldn't be in the car with them, you had to look at them in a completely different way, like they weren't even real people. I was working with my interior decorator, which was a big step for me because he was gay and I would have to ride in a car [with him] to go pick out fabrics and furniture. And I'd always think, What if a picture of me got shot and they put it on the Internet and they all said that's my boyfriend? Then in hip-hop, they would be like, ""Oh, Kanye's gay, so we can't listen to his raps because he broke a rule of hip-hop.""
RS: You break them, and you keep on breaking them, I would say
KW: Yeah. Now that I've broken that, I feel much freer that I can be creative and not deal with stereotypes. America beats stereotypes into people. Recently there was this whole Bonnaroo situation. I didn't realize that actual racism was still alive, because at a certain point, once you become famous, you're no longer black or white, you're just green-you're just money. So when you walk in any store there's a certain level of: ""Oh, he's not a black guy. He's a famous guy now!"" When I went to that Bonnaroo festival in Tennessee, they definitely reminded me that I was a black guy. On 12 port-a-potties they wrote in bold letters fuck kanye. They didn't allow my crew to load on the stage; the promoter allowed Pearl Jam to do three encores. The sun was starting to come up, and the whole point of my show was that it was glow in the dark. They bled my cryo tanks so I wouldn't have smoke. I felt so naïve, cause it clicked in my head: Oh, wow, this is really done on purpose
RS: Being popular, is it something you want?

All his time, all he had, all he had 
In what he dreamed 
All his cash, market crashed 
Hurt him bad, people get divorced for that 
Drops some stacks pops is good 
Momma pass in Hollywood 
If you ask, lost my soul 
Driving fast, lost control 
Off the road, jaw was broke 
'Member we all was broke 
'Member I'm coming back 
I'll be taking all the stacks 
I got broads in Atlanta 
Twisting dope, lean, and the Fanta 
Credit cards and the scammers 
Hitting off licks in the bando

Going out like I'm Montana

Now look, I'm straight pissed
I'm bout to unroll my fist
Duct tape it when I roll through the SiX
And the theory of everything don't teach shit
So the real gangstas are still on the streets
Tryna teach a toddler how to pack heat
Well, life ain't shit then you die
Everything's the truth until one thing's a lie
In Missouri, got a story to tell
And no, it ain't bout no white girl fall in a well
This a legend, got more viewers than Saved By The Bell
If you don't wanna hear it then you can go to hell
It started last week, on the day on the fourth
Nigga got more snow on 'em, than Snow White and a dwarf

Now whatcha finna hear is an update
On what we been on as of late
See I was reading a late notice on the date that I wrote this, you hear
Time flies in the Leer
And you wonder where the day went
See I'm a leader in my field, but I'm behind on my truck payments
So this is something that could help you raise your head like hello
See this is not brown red or yellow
Not a white or black poem
This is a prayer to a guardian angel
To protect our fathers. mothers, sisters, brothers, sons and daughters
Until we bring our troops back home
Cause it feel like we all in the same platoon
And we'll all be extinct soon
If we continue to suffer from other people's crimes
I think we well overdo for change
This time
And I know they don't wanna see me cooped up in a Benz
They'd rather see me cooped up these pens
Therefore I release the ink that's cooped up in these pens
And let my art-ticulate
People are so slow to love, but so quick to hate
Now some things finna change because we say so
Lets stop looking at how bad things are
And focus on how well they may go
And this is a declaration
That we'll be fair again
Especially to those Americans
Who were Americans, before there were Americans
This is to a small young family that's booming out of space
There's room in outer space
This is to my people
The human race

Chance Bennett, a peculiar name
Graduation night teachers Ferris Bueller'd my name
You made a mixtape? Good job, I hope you get a good job
We was all outcasts, only listened to Good Mob
I performed at fun fair
Fun fact, I'm never going back to school
Been there, done that
They see my little 10 Day tape and my dumb raps
Don't call it impossible, if you really want that
They send my ass to summer school, don't call it a comeback
I just came to beat a bully's ass and get my lunch back
Chano y tequila you know you know you don't want that

[P.S. Malone - October 27, 2017]
Deep in the heart of the Alaskan wastelands, miles removed from human civilization, an oversized, overpowered, all-terrain monster truck barrelled across the frozen tundra. Behind the wheel sat P.S. Malone, his smile glittering of diamonds and gold.
Malone was not your typical smuggler, who wore mundane clothes and kept a low profile. He was flashy, and gritty, and looked untrustworthy—a crooked redneck from the dirty south, with frayed braids, a patchy beard, and an insatiable lust for all things shiny. Even if it meant trekking to the coldest ends the earth, every export had its price.
The sun was at its apex and sparkled brightly off the powdered floor. Otherwise, Malone held the earth's highest vantage, and a bird's eye view across the land. White snow met blue skies everywhere he looked, joining together along one distant horizon. He gazed over the world in wonderment and awe. This must be how God felt watching over his creation.
Billows of smoke clouded the windshield, as the smuggler puffed a joint as thick as a Cuban cigar. He had an entire tin of them stored in his jacket pocket, pacing himself for the long journey ahead.
P.S. Malone couldn't get much higher.
With the butt of the joint wedged firmly in a jewel-encrusted grin, he reached his free hand into a bag on the passenger's seat. He felt a childlike giddiness rummaging through the contents—two hundred thousand dollars, stacked and bound. His heftiest payday to date. There was a bonus fifty thousand available as well, but only if he reached his destination by midnight. The directions were simple and easy to follow.
Follow the compass due south. You'll know when you find us. He'd even been told to underline it.
The contraband was strapped to the bed of the pickup truck on account of the bumpy ride. Cases of bourbon mostly, a few of vodka and gin, and four large suitcases stacked in the centre, zipped and bound with plastic cables. Malone had cut open one of the straps to see what they were hiding, but found nothing inside except candles in glass jars.
Perhaps he'd grown accustomed to to dangerous goods, or maybe spending six months in waiting along the north-Alaskan shores had hyped him up for a role more glorious than rum-runner. He had hoped for something a tad more exciting. Something to brag about when he returned to Dallas, a quarter of the way to millionaire status.
But for now he was focused on the road ahead, racing for his keep.
Malone lost patience with each passing hour, wondering how much farther he had to go. At four o'clock, the sun began its descent, though it was the only thing that changed. By five o'clock, it had disappeared behind the horizon, though the skyline still glowed of fuchsia and gold.
By six o'clock, only darkness—but still no end in sight. Was he the one who was getting swindled? He dove his hand into the bag beside him to ensure the money was still his.
After several more hours, the now-weary Malone spotted a shape in the distance. Hard to make out from so far away, but with a clear silhouette in the glare of his high beams. The engine roared in pure delight as he thrust his foot on the pedal and sent two-tonnes of motorized muscle bounding through the night.
Soon, he recognized the outline of a cabin, not much bigger than a garden shed. There weren't any vehicles outside the property, nor any smoke wafting from the chimney, but Malone could hear a faint echo in the distance.
Thirty yards from the shelter he rolled to a stop.
Any hopes his journey had ended were immediately put to rest. Something had smashed its way in through the door. The bottom half lay in shards buried in the snow. The top hinge was still clinging for its life, screeching in mercy as the wind kept tossing it into the door frame.
“Hello?” he called out through his window. “Anybody in there?”
He waited, but could only hear the incessant banging of the door. Back-and-forth it swung like a pendulum, then all in an instant it stopped. After a moment of stillness, it tore from its hinge, and came crashing to the ground.
A white hare bounded out of the cabin—the first sign of life since he left. It darted away from the crumbling wreckage, and hopped straight into the light of the high beam.
Malone took it mean there was no one inside, but had no interest checking. If this was meant to be his final destination, then he'd been taken for a ride. He grabbed for a joint to help him think, but found the tin was empty.
That's when he noticed the hare now perched on its hind legs. It's long, pointy ears were like two large antennas, and its tiny pink nose was sniffing curiously in his direction. For a moment it locked eyes with him through the windshield, then turned away and bounded ahead, leaving a trail in the path of his headlights. Several times it paused and looked back at truck—as if expecting him to follow.
Malone eased his foot off the brake, and began rolling toward his furry escort. He followed it along a modest incline, no different from the hundreds of slopes he'd conquered to this point. As he rounded the summit however, Malone's jewel-encrusted jaw fell open in awe.
He was seated atop a massive gorge, descending as deep as the ocean floor. Through the darkness he could see the shadows of a forest, rooted deep in the valley below. It was both immense and immaculate—something he might find in National Geographic. A fjord of trees winding through a wintery canyon, extending so far into the distance Malone couldn't see his end. Even from atop the vale, Malone could smell the pine.
He looked over his shoulder at the old, ravaged shelter, and the endless expanse of barren terrain. The forest, conversely, was bursting with life and at least offered a grain of hope. For a time he sat there twisting his beard, ruminating over the rest of his money and the dwindling hours until midnight.
'Follow the compass due south,' he read. 'You'll know when you find us.'
Malone jolted his foot on the gas, tearing down the ridge as the white hare hurdled out of his way.
Driving into the forest was like stumbling upon a hidden utopia. A single passageway had been cleared from brush, barely wide enough to fit his hulking pickup. As an endless stream of trees pressed in either side, Malone gripped both hands tight to the wheel.
At first the woods were a welcome change of scenery; he was tired of navigating endless white seas. Yet constantly dodging tree trunks was onerous work, and forced him down to a frustratingly slow pace. With only three hours left to claim his bonus, time was now of the essence.
With two hours until midnight, Malone felt no closer to his destination. He had hoped to have cleared the forest by now, but it was only getting thicker. Exhaustion was setting in as well, so he rolled down the window to feel the air on his face.
Kanye Omari West can be labelled many things; an artist, an egomaniac, a God, a Rapper and as of June 2013, a father. But before all of these other labels where placed upon him, he was a producer, under the wing of NO ID, thanks to his mother, the late Donda West. After some local success, Ye hit the proverbial jackpot by adding his own touch to Jay Z's classic ""The Blueprint"". From there, West would continue working towards his debut album, ""The College Dropout"", which would change the Gangsta Rap sound of the mainstream to a more gentle, conscious tone.
On Lucifer, one of the tracks from Hov's The Black Album, West sampled and edited the pitch of Max Romeo's I Chase The Devil.
Echoing part of a line from Isaiah 14:12 in the Bible initially gives the instrumental a Spiritual feeling to it, but to twist the vocals of the sample (much like he did with Through The Wire) gives it a much more soulful feeling. Add in two or three verses relating to death and vengeance and you have a prime example of West's intricately contrasting art form; bringing together the righteous connotations of “Lucifer son of the morning, I'm gonna chase you out of earth” and the dark, vengeful tale from Hov's past. Ye even got a shout out from Jigga for the beat!
Fast-forward to almost a decade later and you have arguably the best single of 2011; Cruel Summer's Mercy.
Although not solely produced by Ye, this song is also a prime example of West's iconic production. The Fuzzy Jones sample, which again relies on a Bible verse, is sped up and pitch-edited, making it hard to distinguish what is actually being said by the Dancehall Legend. Then bring in the hook — also supposedly a sample — of pointless braggadocio (Lamborghini Mercy/Yo chick she so thirsty) and the culture-blending contrast between the sample and the actual song speak for themselves.
Next we go backwards a couple of years to West's epic fairytale-esque My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.
Power, the theme song of West's self-centric tour de force, has three samples that make it as epic, as powerful as it is, the first of which is found in the chorus and the second of which, the sample that adds the soul of The College Dropout into the mixing pot of defiance and self-righteousness that is so explicitly Kanye West, comes from Continent Number 6's “Afroamerica”.

One thing that makes me mad is when people get foolish
On Halloween, people start to feel like they're kinda ghoulish
Comin' into my face, sayin' ""Hey can I get a picture?
Can I get a picture of you and your son?"" and I say ""Hold on, I don't want one""
Step back, get away, give me my space
Wait, give me my space, because I may Chris Brown you and punch you dead in your motherfuckin' face
Because I don't like people comin' into my category, into my area
Because they cause mass hysteria
It gets scarier, or should I say it's scary
Because I can hit high notes, kick in your nuts like Mariah Carey
And that's the way it is, so those things make me mad
When my momma passed away, that was the thing that made Big Boy really sad
We're talkin' about mad, we're talkin' 'bout gettin' frustrated
We're talkin' about before me and my girl got married, before we dated
We're talkin' about when people say things about my momma or my family
You can't do that to me, because you can't trust me
Now I'm Ida's son, Keith's brother, Sheila's brother, Kenny's brother
Sharell's brother, Nicole's brother, Sharnice's brother, a whole lot of brothers
But anyway, let me get back on topic
That's the way it is when I kick freestyles, let me stop it
So Kanye, you're here
What makes you mad? Make it clear
I'm fallin' off, let me put my shoes back on, let me tie 'em up
Kanye, here you go, brother, could you please fill up our cup?
Uh, I guess I get mad when you get boxed in
skrrt skrrt
So mad, you're gonna turn to Tyson
skrrt skrrt
Paparazzi, I'm like a nazi to 'em
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
More like the next Sinatra to 'em
Uh, ayo I got to ruin
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Ayo, before I lose it, and have to prove it
This the way that we gon' do it, time we gotta move it to the future
Kamasutra
Any way that suit yah
Don't shoot yah
Stop the violence and it's been stopped
Uh, we stopped the violence in the hip-hop
Uh, we stopped the hatin' and the degredation
Uh, we 'bout to build like one nation
Uh, got off the phone with Benjamin Carson
skrrt skrrt
Burn it down, burn Hollywood, burn, like Ice Cube said
Uh, I'm the rudest
Lot of people say that, cause they say Ye don't play that
They be off that Grey Goose, I be off that Ye juice
Uh, that's the way I stay loose
skrrt skrrt
Uh, my crib spacial
Uh, my relationship is interracial
I'm livin' in the 21st century

He knows, he's so fucking gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me

And this is disestablishmen-tarianism
With my night goggles on, yeah, military vision
And it's still a very Christian way to think about livin'
When you prayin' for freedom 'cause your mind been in prison
‘Cause they tryin' to control every single big decision
I'm living' in that 21st century
Doing something mean to it

And we gone stay hustling on the block until we caught
And we gone stay showing off that jewelry that we bought
And we gone stay heated in case it's in and out of court
Cause we some gangstas, I don't know what the fuck you thought
Sometimes I think that I gotta see a little bit of brighter days
Cause I confine myself to a city near you in a solid cage
And you could look to the left and the right, but I'm trapped on center stage
And I could rap to the beat, but I don't know how to change my wage
I still hear a pull and I track 'em, and strack 'em, and whack 'em
Jack a nigga for the day to days and I yak 'em, attack 'em, and sack 'em
Get a weapon and I crack his brain cause I'm hustler, baller, pro
And it wouldn't be right for me to be around busters, and crawlers, and hoes
But I'm a pimp at night so talk shit and I'm gonna lift 'em up off of their toes
With a street sweeper regulating quarters, and ki's, and o's
In the two seater, Ludacris and Twista with bags of 'dro
Smoking and choking, get 'em up and croaking
It's so potent, I'm hoping to keep on floating
Soaking wet and you can bet, people I'm high
I'm seeing lions, and tigers and bears - oh my!
And I can't hide it and keep it hidden, good riddance of feeling good
I'm weapon-concealing, stealing my neighborhood
Would, could, and should break a nigga off
They'll see you later, go to the doctor, hold my balls and (cough)
Because the vapors and I caught the drawn, brain blown, honey I'm home
Give me the microphone, and fools is like, ""leave me alone!""

We arose, let's go
So fresh, so clean like 'Kast
Jay-Z be poppin tags
Leavin the mall with heavy bags
You know the boy got a love for the cash
Aw fuck, there he go again
Talkin bout hoes and dough again
Yup! -- Can't hold it in
I'm surprised I got so much dough to spend
But, back when I was poorer then
You wasn't focusin, about the dough I spend
But I was holdin in, I was a roller then
I was a baller back then, all of that man
Fall back, I fought that
What would you do if you was in my shoes?
Leave dudes in the rearview
V-12 engine, corners spinnin
Twinkies shinin, pinky ring
Armadale, nigga stinky stink
Top, down, my cash is up
Gold chain, I don't give a fuck
Gold brain'll get you in the truck ma
That's right, you in luck ma
You see me cruisin down, better step inside
Ain't enough room to fit you all in the ride
First come, first served basis
You know Hov' be goin to nice places
That's right, and I'm droppin cash
Leave the mall with garbage bags
Gucci this, Prada that
Roll witcha boy you'll be poppin tags
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
It's a party when I go up in the sto'
Shoppin while I'm zooted off the dro'
Rollin like a nigga that just came up on a mill'
And I got 'em sweepin and pickin up tags off the flo'
Bag full of clothes, I remember havin rocks in the hall
On the corner with the Glock by the balls
Servin up a jab and workin security 6 to 6
Then it's straight from the block to the mall
Buy what's on the wall
Go ahead and treat yo'self
When you come up on some cheddar better pop that tag
Like when I dip off in the Prada then I go off
To the lot and lay the paper down and cop that Jag
I got a closet full of ammunition and funds
Mink, Roc-a-Wear and some guns
Pelle and a fresh pair of Jordan's
Dro packs and “Bo Jack's” and Air Max's; throwbacks and “1's”
No max for none
(When I go up in the sto' a nigga never get enough)
I'm a baller and if you want it come and get it now
(Nigga come to a race with a car you won't catch up)
And the Twista kinda wicked when I spit it now
I be choppin up cheddar with Kanye
Chop a little cheddar up with Jay
Chop it up with the O-to-the-Kizay
Poppin big tags with the flow and the dough, we get bi-zay!

To My nigga
Who brought me in this world
Ha, that's right nigga
My old dad important to the family structure
A provider A God
My moms a queen, that universal team civalized us
My pops maybe was late but always came home
My moms would put us to bed and she would wait on
Soon as he walk in the door she barking
I turned down the Johnny Carson
Jumped out the bed
We grabbed both his legs
Me and my brother
Not knowing the pain he gave my mother
Night after night, fighting yelling at each other
My papa played the street all day
Mama was either home, at work, while we played inside the hall way
She sacrifices all she got to feed us
When she was alone she cried by the phone peeping out the window heated
But still I didn't see it
Mama hid it from us
We was kids younger
Till we got bigger, on to
Bigger things that we knew what the time was
That daddy was leaving his crib and mom's love
Papa was player, player wasn't papa
Papa loved the ladies
Never got enough of
Pretty brown round
Running round town (Shhhhh)
Don't tell your mother what's going down
So many kids I knew, never knew who Pap was
That's why I show my pop love
He was still around when I popped up
He could have left
My moms pregnant shook to death but stayed
Watch me crawl till I took my first step, to the first grade
To my first fist fight
Right behind me he would stand
No matter how big or tall he made me fight you like a man
skrrt skrrt
Kids shot by sick cops
Vids fly, moms cry ""Please stop""
Bloody roots, hands up don't shoot
Before body bags, bodies sag
In momma's hands
skrrt skrrt
Dropped outta school now we dumb rich (dumb rich)
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (one shit)
All my niggas wanna do is pop style (pop style)
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle (a lifestyle)
Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it (do not make it)
Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum
(They do, they do)
And I like to finish what you think you started
Man you boys just got to Hollywood, you boys just started
You don't know what you just started
All I do is hang with the young and heartless
All this for my family, man, I try my hardest
It's all I ever did and look where it got him
Yeah, you've been on my mind lately
You've still got my number, girl you need to call me
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way
But you know I always handle that one my way
Girl let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me cause they never got me

Nigga quit playin' before I swipe my card
I know you star, stuntin' for these broads
Nigga don't make me swipe my card
Peep the ice game
What the fuck? Are you a retard?
Preface
In this conversation, Kanye West and Pharrell Williams candidly explore the rewards and perils of a lifelong, perfectionist ethic. Best likened to a child's insatiable curiosity, they impute their compulsive, insistent tinkering to much lived experience, and even to obscure neurological phenomena. Their exchange lends precious – and comic – insight into a frightening capacity for invention, and a knowing approach to craft that is at once sure and relentlessly self-critical. They spoke in the wake of a minor controversy that followed the online launch of the single “Theraflu”, which Kanye released through his G.O.O.D Music label (in collaboration with DJ Khaled, DJ Pharris and the producer Hit Boy). Predictably, the pharmaceutical combine Novartis objected to the title. The track also featured the lyric “someone tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor,” which drew immediate fire from the animal-rights group
Kanye West: Yo yo, what's good?!
Pharrell Williams: What up, killer?!
KW: Shit, chillin', vibin' about changing the name of that song and trying to figure out what the name of the song should be. You know, the “Theraflu” song?
PW: Yeah
KW: Yeah, we're about to give it a new name
PW: It's getting that big – they're going that crazy about it?
KW: Oh, yeah they have an issue. Just the title and here's still a window of opportunity for us to change it. “Oh, well, I don't want to call it ‘Theraflu'. I'm calling the song this…” And then people are like, “oh, he changed the song to this”, and then that's what it is, because when I did the song, I actually did not know that it would get to the point that grandmothers are talking about it, you know? Like why did I give them that level of promotion?
PW: Yeah, trust me, they're thankful. No matter what, they're thankful. This segues perfectly into what I wanted to talk to you about. Which is what is it like to be – and I know how I feel about it – but you're definitely one of my peers, and one that I look at and say “He gets it, but I'd love to hear his take on why we aspire to be.” It's almost a disease to be a perfectionist. Nothing is ever quite good enough. What is it like to look at things and say to yourself, “I know that they don't get it but maybe one day they will.”
KW: It is so funny this is such an example of being a perfectionist, right? This song is out and I'm going to change the name, like I want to perfect this moment some more. Well, I think it's just if you're a perfectionist, that's just what you do. You know, there are slackers there are people who are satisfied by delivering everything they have – with their knowledge, their financial situation, their level of exposure – to deliver the best product possible. I respect, look up to, and look to Walt Disney and Steve Jobs who dedicated their time, soul and energy to delivering the best product that they knew they could. There's a lot of psychology that goes into it. What can you give to human existence? How can you push the culture forward? And when you're a perfectionist, at a certain point you feel a responsibility in what you put out, and what could trickle down from it. If you put out things that are so over-the-top and magnificent, what trickles down from it could at least be good because there are more followers than there are leaders
PW: Yeah I agree…You know what the funny thing is that we've never done it on a Kanye West album, it might be time for that
KW: Yeah!
PW: It might be time for that
KW: Yeah, we started on that shit for [Watch] The Throne
PW: Oh yeah! That was a very serious moment…
KW: Yes!
PW: I'll never forget going to you and Jay's show, and just seeing those laser lights. You addressed all the sensations, with the exception of smell and taste, I guess. Anything that you could control, the auditory and the visual, you curated – you made sure that it was a curated moment. And I'll never forget when the first bars of “Gotta Have It” started playing, that minor chord. It just hits you anyway but it was just y'all talking on top of the track as it starts to come on, and the crowd start going nuts! And it's really because at the end of the day, as great as the track is as it is and as great as all of the stuff you guys did on top of it, it was how the moment was so set up. It was like an incredible layup, an alley-oop. Do people even say that word anymore, alley-oop?
KW: Yeah, it's only ‘cause it happens
PW: [laughs] yeah, you know I don't know anything about basketball, but it was an amazing set-up. That was crazy, just to see the reaction to what a visual and music could do together, and those people going absolutely crazy I was like “oh, ok, well done man, well done.”
KW: Yeah I definitely wanted to dial into that sound and mixing those textures together. I just want to dial into that more, I just want to set the note, like playing a few textures that I got for this new shit for the G.O.O.D. Music joint we opened up the album with this joint that me and Skrillex did together
PW: Mmmmm. I like that!
KW: Just like that!
PW: Wow, I can't wait to hear what that sounds like. I know we are all shaped and moulded by all that we've gone through, and by having spirituality – in whatever way you define it – it allows us to be bigger than our bodies, to be bigger than our essence. [But] there is something to be said for experience, being told “no” the entire time, when you wanted to get into an industry that you love. So let me ask you, how much has this experience contributed to who you became as a person?
KW: Yeah, you know, I had to realize at what point to put off the real South Side Chicago mentality, that is what built me to deal with the amount of “no's” and deal with the amount of pressure and aggression, like I talked about on this Chicago song, “mink is draggin' on the floor.” That's one of my ideas for it [renaming ‘Theraflu']. “Swag King Cole, mink is dragin' on the floor, fo' I embarrass you, but I don't like to embarrass you…'I Don't Like To Embarrass You” as the title
PW: Anticipating PETA
KW: Yeah, so…when I say “I'm from where shorty's fucked up, double-cupped up. Might even kill some-body and YouTube it, so whoever thinks their words affect me is too stupid, and if you think you can do it better than me, then you do it.”

Pinocchio, lied, and that's what kept him from it
I tell the truth, and I keep running
It's like I'm lookin out there, tryna find something
I turn on the TV, and see me, and see nothing
So what does it feel like, to live real life, to be real
Not some facade that no one can really feel
Do you really have the stamina?
For everybody that sees you that say, wait a second ""Where's my camera?""
For everybody that sees you, to say sign can you sign a autograph
For everybody that sees you cryin, say you oughta laugh

So I had to cop the baby mama benz JEEP
We'll put 50 I get this on the first take
But that 50'll break the bank
skrrt skrrt
Had a girl nickname sprewell 'cause when I tried to stop
She still made me spend
Back when Avies was in, my dog crazy kid had eighty of them
It's time to hit the dance floor get crazy again
And get that +CashMoney+ like Baby and Slim
Pull up in something tinted, so tinted she squinted
She said ""This car real old""; I told her it was vintage
And I need to hit the health club
And get a girl that's into the fitness
Tryin to get into the business, Imma make her my apprentice
skrrt skrrt
And let me get insiiiide
South Gate's finest, not quite a legend
I wanna do things that you could never imagine
Sitting on my couch having way too many dreams
If I'm gonna play the game, I gotta pick a better team
They always say that I look like I'm pissed off
Your voice is clouding up my head, just piss off
Too much grime in this game, I think I need to rinse off
What you scared for? Take your window tints off
""David, open up more!"" Okay, here I go
I'm a disrespectful monster when I let my feelings flow
Oh, you know? Man, who told you?
I just pray to God that their perspective hasn't sold you
I'm still the kid that's always putting others first
You should recognize I could've ended up worse
Funny how it goes though, funny how I changed
Everything I hate is everything that I became
Putting my hands to the constellations
Looking at the facts and ignoring allegations
Whatever they told you has gotta be a lie
Please don't shut me out, I'm still a nice guy
Never getting into trouble, never fighting with the law
Yeah I make mistakes but everybody's got a flaw
Looking through my lens, I know nothing's picture perfect
But the promise of a paradise makes the pain worth it
I'll be the best M-E, not the best MC
As hop in this two door
We ride to the wheels fall off
You know, looking for hoes
It's amazing what these windows expose
In Chicago keep em close or we rob your auto
Thinking of ways to hit the lotto
Thinking of ways to fix tomorrow
My grandma said I ain't shit but sorrow
No pot to piss
No dish to borrow
So who to follow
Obama didn't come back
Ye didn't come back
Man where my gun at?
I need everything you got boy run that
Go and finesse with the hoes I got money
In the back of my mind I never done that
I Probably will with this lifestyle I'm funding
I gotta get it these kids ain't never called bum and
I'll be dammed if tomorrow is the day that I'll become that
I go to school in the burbs
Them girls out there steady be working my nerves
They always tryna swerve but it's hard to explain where you live
When you don't barely got a room that is yurs
But 87th and Loomis shit what you doing
We can kick it on the porch or something just to get in tune with
Each other
""Give me a second to ask my mother boo
She said naw that's where them niggas shoot""
skrrt skrrt
Twinkle twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are
Up so far and shine so bright Will you grant my wish tonight?

My only wish is that I live out what I say I will
You a bad girl, and your friend's bad too (ooh)
We got the swag sauce, she dripping swagu
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, ooh

Don't be so Paranoid
[Big Sean; Verse 1]
Aye, Aye
Now baby I can tell you want more cause you put less out
And every time you stepped in I could tell you stepped out
Your girlfriend said I remind her of the rest, yea
But tell yo girlfriend that she remind me of the Press

And you can tell from the watch and chain
They been in and out my jeans like pocket change
Just be real, man I wouldn't be real
If I ain't have my fair share like the stock exchange
And if today tend from your past relations
Walk around witcho girl sayin that you hate men (What?)
Aye yo you either let go or you go lesbo turn around and date them
So maybe we should head to the exit
Just is from your friends not to mess with (Who me?)
Cause they caught a case with they ex-es
They mad you'd a leave while a nigga ex-stressed
But we know what it is right?
So we gone let 'em live right?

Standing in the rain, blood flowing through my veins
I ain't never did a thing, getting money, rocking chains
We'll never feel the same, we the thugs in the game
I don't never feel pain
18 wheeler gorillas
Black with gold chains, pitch bird like steelers
Hines Ward of the crime lords
Running through this money screaming ""encore""
Spending nights with the prime whore
But that's the bitch that you're blind for
Celebrating on a whim, nigga
Pain is Pac above the rim, nigga
My bitch rock a bigger gem, niggas
Cause she was there when it was dim, nigga
She wasn't fucking none of them niggas
So now we're even like a hem, nigga
Put your freedom over failure
Tryna find my Griselda (La Madrina!)
Might as well, they gon' nail ya
Momma screaming like Mahalia
Pain is love and it's war
Pain is running out of raw
Pain is finding out you're poor
As the feds knock at your door
I dont never feel pain, cause I done felt too much pain
Been around here, standing in the rain, blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing, getting money, rocking tons of gold chains

Yeah, history in the makin, Do or Die
Yeah, yeah, uh, uh, uh

Cold pimp tactics all in one package
Hollerin' at a chick that could of been a actress

Why your team pissed like urine
Only rock things made for a king
Tell me tell me it was the LV
Bigger that the jeans of the
Rap floor green

Hotter than your shit
Bullshit, got a full clip

Lyrics so hot enough for frozen snow
Feel of the bomb again and get fucked the he say she say
He say she say I ain't gon make it
The throne is my mine
Chi-town where's the crown

I'll take one question. I wanted to vibe off an idea, and then I can riff off of that…they said I've got 20 minutes or so, I might go longer
OK, everyone please be completely quiet, because I can literally hear a whisper, and it'll throw off my stream of consciousness, and when I get my stream of consciousness going that's when I give the best, illest quotes. Literally, a whisper can throw it off
Today was the first time I realised, If I could have done it again I would have gone to the Art Institute over the American Academy of Art, I would have researched where I could have got the best and the strongest education
And I'm sure this will end up online, so I don't want to diss anyone at the American Academy, I'm sure it's equal to the Art Institute of Chicago by now, but at the time I was going I would look around at the work of the class and not feel inspired by the teachers, and I kinda, the idea of being a fine artist, that's a really difficult profession to get into, to be respected in, to make money at. Maybe the goal for some of the people was just to work at an advertising agency or at a record label
My goal, if I was going to do art, fine art, would have been to become Picasso or greater
That always sounds so funny to people, comparing yourself to someone in the past that has done so much, and in your life you're not even allowed to think that you can do as much. That's a mentality that suppresses humanity
Some of you here probably remember the night when the Donda tweets came through me and I started talking about professions that you guys are going into, that seemed they had nothing to do with a rapper. I was talking about a band of thinkers that could remove religion, race, gender, and somehow come together to find solutions for a broken planet
We have the resources as a civilization to find a utopia, but we're led by the most greedy and the least noble
What I notice about creatives is that, and one of the reasons why I get into trouble, is, not only do I want to design video games, or make music, or ride bikes, I think one of the most important things to my ability to create so much in the past 30 years is my desire to play sports. I approach creativity like a sport, where if I have a drawing I react just like a jock: LOOK AT THE FUCKING DRAWING RIGHT THERE YEAH!
We're all creatives here, we're all born artists. Some people are artists of business, some people are artists of composition
We were taught to hide our black fingernail polish and put our head down in the back of the class and not notice out of fear that someone might laugh at one of our ideas – that our idea could become a mockery or a failure in some way
There's a Bible saying, ‘No weapon formed against me shall prosper'. Recently I've been doing interviews and I've had to go back to this verse because I don't think there's a living celebrity with more weapons formed against them, but I also don't think there's one more prosperous. So what weapons have prospered? The smoke and mirrors of other opinions
I was sitting with Steve McQueen, he shot the visuals for All Day two days ago, it's completely different to the Brit awards
So it doesn't get taken out of context, I'm going to use the word ‘like'. I'm not saying it is, I'm using it as a comparison. So people that want to say ‘Kanye goes to Oxford and tells everyone blah blah blah'. And I'm not telling you this. I'm telling you what I told Steve McQueen in private
What I said was The Matrix is like the Bible of the post-information age
I compared it like, when the hundred guys come at Neo, those are opinions, that's perception, that's tradition. Attacking people from every which angle possible. If you have a focus wide and master senses like Laurence Fishburne and you have a squad behind you, you literally can put the world in slow motion
It's still February, right? (security guard shakes his head, everyone laughs)
By the way, I don't know the days of the week. I just go to exactly when my appointment is
We'd just look at each other and say, it's still February. For the sheer mount of work that we were able to put into the world. Some of the stuff had been worked on for years coming, months coming. But nonetheless they came back to back to back to back. Answering every crazy interview question, blocking every shot, catching every rebound. Aside from the right I don't have to give my opinion publicly about artists, I probably would have been batting 2000. I know that's incorrect also
This humanity that I talk about, this civilization that I talk about, this future utopia I talk about…it can only happen through collaboration
I love Steve Jobs, he's my favorite person, but there's one thing that disappoints me. When Steve passed he didn't give the ideas up. That's kinda selfish. You know that Elon's like ‘yeah, take these ideas'. Maybe there are companies outside of Apple that could work on them and push humanity forward. Maybe the stock brokers won't like that, the stock holders wouldn't like that idea, but ideas are free and you can't be selfish with them
I think that progression of mind with the advent of a human being named Drake (laughs, smirks, crowd laughs) you know, this idea of holding onto a number 1 spot. And then you get this guy that comes and blows out the water every number 1 of any band ever. Be it me, or Paul McCartney [laughs]
I understand that I'm a servant. And with my voice, with my ability to build relationships with amazing people, speak to amazing people. Call Elon Musk out of the blue, or call Obama out of the blue…he calls the home phone, by the way
With that, I have a responsibility to serve. Why do I say the Matrix is like the Bible? What is my definition of the Matrix? [he never answered this]
I work with an artist called Vanessa Beecroft, and she bought my daughter some toys
I'd see toys that some people would buy for my daughter and I'd say this toy isn't quality. I don't want my daughter playing with this. There's not enough love put into this, this is just manufactured with the will to sell, and not the will of inspiration
Oh you didn't think we can it again
Twista, Kanye West, from Po Pimping to Poppin Tags
From Chunkiest to Slow Jamz, oh baby
We can even make you a overnight celebrity
Know what I'm saying, come on Why don't we, play something these hoes'd like

(I could make you a celebrity overnight) Girl I see you, in them apple bottom jeans
Chinchilla on your back, I wanna know your name
Girl I'm Twista, I could blow your brains
Put you in a chameleon, 0-4 Range
Still sexy, when you smoke that flame
Jerk you like a chicken, when you throw that thang
She got me hotter than a oven, the way that she talk
Switching to freaky, so I'm loving the way that she walk
You looking good girl, you oughta be in pictures
Listen to me, I see your career going sky high
Taking you home to the crib, in the Chi
And everytime I see your thighs, I cry when I drive by
Watching you should be a thrill, got the fellas
Hustling trying to get, steady screaming my-my-my-my
Walk on the carpet, with the bells that flick in the dark
Kicking it on the couch, at 106 & Park
I can see your beauty, on the big screen
I can see me freaking you, with whip cream
I can see you on stage, at the awards
With a dress better than Jennifer's, and doing big things
Kick it with me, I can mold your life
You looking good girl, show you right
Dre told me, you the prototype
I can make you a celebrity overnight Why don't we, play something these hoes'd like

(I could make you a celebrity overnight) You want fame, you can take that path
Candlelights, when you take a bath
Fuck these rappers...
Pussy actors...
Looking at the cover...
Thinking how to fuck half of these bitches get a deal
Now raise your hands if you feel me
But I don't really care if you don't
I gotta get that fame even if it kill me
But I know it will probably won't
Step up in my rap game but I really don't have to
They are rapping like they gotta I am rapping like I have to
She'd be giving me the looks
Call the fire squad on me cause I'm spreading the flame
I dunno if it's worth mentioning, so easy, replaced
Like a fucking pandemic when you're hearing my name
It's seeping right through your brain, it's the chemical to fame
I don't know what you're gonna say, why you staring at me?
You're stuck in that single space, got nowhere you can be?
It's like a picture perfect frame when you're failing to see
The lost potential of your time and your reason to breathe
Boy, I've got 20 minutes, tell me the truth
Do you really wanna come and spit some fire in the booth?
Will you go out of your way, make it go hard and go boom?
Cause really, what's the fucking point of letting you in that room?
If you've got no reasoning, wanna make a Hotline Bling
Make a stupid fucking video, be sure you're dancing
Around like a fucking idiot, testing my patience
I'm fairly certain that the end result's a gun, a bullet, hey
I dunno if I even have a damn point
I'm writing, spitting all this shit but I'm sounding so coy
With almost everything I say, I'm not a kid, not a boy
But you know that I'm the kid, I'm that one you call, boy
I'm sorry if I have toyed with your emotions before
I'm just so fucking used to blaming everything on a whore
Whether it's one that I dated or the one I replaced
It's fucking crazy, a matrix in mind, call me Satan
I pretend like I've got no ego or shame
But at the end of the day, I've got an ego, no shame
It's the pain of processing everything, man, I'm so lame
Around every single person that comes up in my face
Like, what the fuck do you want and what the fuck should I do?
I dunno if there's any reasoning watching me, watch you
And everyone in your crew, because they're talking so hard
But at the end of the day, words only got you so far, hey
Call the cops cause I commited a crime
I tried to be original but it's a waste of my time
I brought a pen and a pad, writing down every line
But at the end of the day, it's just a waste of my time
Another verse, another time for me to shine

I got a girl at home but she don't cook
I have my condoms in the stove cause she won't look
And she never ever go to the grocery store
So I figure its safe to pull a grocery ho
She was buyin Alize out the liquor isle
She said ""I hope its not too ghetto""
Rocked all gold force back in style
I kept her number on file for my girl be actin wild
Like last week I told her take me to the mall
skrrt skrrt
My other girl picked me up at 3:05
She got a brand new car, 16
Now the car only 1 years old, oh
Man but the body look grown, whoa
Before I catch a case I better take my ass home
Where the problems is, arguments be Daly like Carson is
But the problem is..
We can't even sit and talk no more, without you arguing 
Girl you must be out of your mind, no no no 
You're the one who started it 
Hold up, wait a second man
That's that thrift store info, that's all second hand 
Why don't you talk to the mouth of the horses 'bout my Porsches 
Condos in front of the golf courses 
Instead you stay up, countin every second like a fake Roley 
I'm real, so you know I move real slowly

INES and Foxy Show
Shia, you suck bad!
As the world's turning, feel like I'm a worse person
My tongue's hurting, from all of its work cursing
And I'm not certain, I think my father's LeVar Burton
Till I'm walking in circles and I'm talking in third person
In the eighth grade I got high off paper mache
I put it in my desk and I let it ferment a day
Because ain't nothing changed, I'm still known as a rude student
That'll walk inside your class and make fun of your school shooting
I can prove it, I'm too cool as a matter of fact
I been writing these verses while I'm having a heart attack
I'm in your bedroom cranking on out and staring black
Stereo blaring, Gwen Steffani can holla back
I'm not black, I'm a white boy with dark skin
At a Klan rally wondering why they won't let me in
It makes it easier, easier to bear
You won't regret it, no, no, no
Some girls, they don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
Squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her
(Sounds so soulful, don’t you agree?)
skrrt skrrt
I invented swag, poppin bottles, putting supermodels in the cab
Proof, I guess I got my swagger back, truth
New watch alert: Hublots
Or the big face Rollie, I got two of those
Arm out the window through the city, I maneuver slow
Cock back, snap back, see my cut through the holes

Damn Yeezy and Hov, where the hell ya been?
Niggas talking real reckless; stuntmen
I adopted these niggas, Phillip Drummond them
Now I’m about to make them tuck their whole summer in
They say I’m crazy, but I’m about to go dumb again
They ain't seen me cause I pulled up in my other Benz
Last week I was in my other other Benz
Throw your diamonds up cause we in this bitch another 'gain
skrrt skrrt
Photo shoot fresh, looking like wealth
I’m 'bout to call the paparazzi on myself
Live from the Mercer
Run up on Yeezy the wrong way, I might murk ya
Flee in the G450 I might surface
Political refugee, asylum can be purchased

I see you in the lonely place
How can you be so blind
You still regretting the love you left, left behind
Oh darling, I seen you go through the changes
Sitting alone each night
Are you expecting to find the love, love that's right
Darling open your eyes
Let me show you light
Oh ohh oh ohhhhhhhh!

Extravaganza
from
Jamie Fox, featuring Kanye West
First Verse:
Last night me and my dogs was hanging out
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Off from work today, so it's all right
But all those ups and downs, turned me in a twist
skrrt skrrt
Then every record became our favorite song
And that is all that I remember
skrrt skrrt
'cause I had one too many drinks
skrrt skrrt
With this pretty little thing, from Memphis Tennessee
It was a one night extravaganza
Second Verse:
When I woke up from last night's ""salvatry""
Baby doll was laying next to me
Shoes and clothes was scattered every where
I got dress and got up out of there
But not before I call for me a cab
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Every thing that I remember
Repeat Chorus: 2x
Bridge:
Extravaganza, Extravaganza
Only was an extravaganza

Umuyorum ki bu bildiğin en gerçek şeydir
Umuyorum ki o her şeyde güzel olan güzel kızları elde edersin
Milyon dolar malikaneler, milyon dolarlık hayaller
Ve hepsini elde ettiğinde tek bir şeyi hatırla
Tek bir şeyi hatırla, bir adamın Dünya'yı değiştirebileceğini
Bir adamın Dünya'yı değiştirebileceğini
Tüm, Tüm istediğim yüz binlerce dolar ve kötü bir kadındı
Bunun çok fazla hayalini kurdum, bazı geceler sahipmişim gibi hissettim
Tekrar yataktayımi tavana bakıyor ve noktaları birleştirmeye çalışıyorum
Ancak o bağları kurmak zor
Çok fazla hayal kurmaktan bahsediyorum, bazı geceler seçilme gecesi gibi hissettirdi
Bilirsin ya? Be-benim üvey abim eskiden o çantaları çevirirdi
Malikanenin dışında sanki çöp günüymüş gibi
Kim K değil, ama o (abisi) toparlandı evet (Evet)
Ancak hızlıca para kazanırken, yavaşla, kaza yapma
Dünya'daki tüm sürüşlerle, yemin ederim hala gaza ihtiyacın var
Bak, düşün, kapa gözlerini, hayalini kur
Takımına söyle, hakkında milyon dolarlık senaryolar kur
Başarı yolda, uzaktan hissedebiliyorum
Eskiden yıldızlara bakar
Ve ''Farklar çok fazla değil mi'' gibi olurdum
Parlıyorum, parlıyorlar, tek şansını al, sakın kaçırma
Her gün bir görevdeymişsin gibi uyanmak hakkında ne biliyorsun?

How do you sleep at night?
Sean, nigga you on, damn, nigga, you on
You was a millionaire but your niggas is still at home
Damn, nigga, you did it, but damn it you did it wrong
You got time for that gig, but not time for the phone
Got it right with your ends, but fucked it up with your friends
I seen your ass up on TV, touched up on them twins
You don't know about hard times, you clutched up in that Benz
Get tired of fuckin' hoes then get to fuckin' their friends, wow
Niggas want handouts, and I only got two
Now I'm on the phone talkin' to my mom like I only got you
Gettin' dressed up for court, that's a law suit
Ain't wearin' V necks, but niggas ask what happened to the crew
Now I'm in court for some shit I didn't do
Cause of my nigga, knowin' my career could've been through
So when it's time to travel management say I only need to
Listenin' to them when I'm the one that makes the rules
I'm just a victim of the life though that I ain't tryna lose
This the dream, I had a wake up call and missed snooze
Lately though my family been too happy
I just turned my mama hooptie to a new Caddy
People thinkin' I'm rich and I wish they knew that
I been signed for four years and I'm just able to do that
Worry 'bout my next Rolex time piece
My nigga Tone worry 'bout our sis, Shanice
You don't want to see these murder guys
Princess cuts hurt your eyes
Got the chicks that work them thighs
Pull the top back on the prowler
Like the car ain't circumcised
Burglarize hoes
Leave your eyes closed
Bricks in my trunk while I ride slow
Smoke your fire dro
No repercussions
He was disgusting
Turn my volume under ten
To keep my speakers from busting
If them people come rushing
Can't say I froze
Won't open the doors
By the time they caught up
I done disposed of my outer clothes
Car in the garage
I say good god
My day was hard
Call two freaks up for the ménage à trois
Parlaying was hard
Sade was suave
When we was screwing
Sheets was ruined
If beef is brewing
I'm a put slugs deep into him
Money they be pursuing
The nerve of these jealous bastards for hatin'
Master my patience
Them custom wood grain caskets is waitin'
Passion for Satan
They must have
Gave them a blood bath
Had to show them who really holding shit down with they tough ass
We alias
They wishing they be us
Can't three-eighty us
Cause we will wreck everything within a ten block radius
When you see me better speak with love
Or leak some blood
I got connections with all type of BM, chiefs and govs
Deeply plugged who got to retire from crime
About to hit that big lick
So we gonna pull it
Hit 'em in the body and the dome
Left the after party with the chrome
Come up with a milly
And as soon as everybody know that I'm gone
Gotta keep it Gangsta'
Cause I'm a hustla'
Do it like a balla'
Cause I'm a mobsta'
Cause it only takes a second to pop me a snitch
Call up my connection to cop me a brick
And he sent a Czechoslovakian chick
She was acting cocky and shit
She like watching blow at the hotel
With big dreams to never stop being rich
And she wasn't too sloppy with dick
When I'm far away from you my baby
I know it's hard for you my baby
Because it's hard for me my baby
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Whisper a little prayer for me my baby
And tell all the stars above
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
You've been on my mind
I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time
Just thinking of your face
[God only knows why it's taken me so long to let my doubts go]
You're the only one that I want
I don't know why I'm scared
I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine
Promise I'm worth it
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me a chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts

If I ain't on these blocks hustlin' I'm on and off the road
I'd rather be in the seat of the 645 with two shotguns
Or in a suite taking off your clothes
And yes, the connection and sex is crazy
But you just want to be like Jodeci, forever my lady
I don't think we on the same page see
I just wanna kick it, hit it, and you tryna have my baby
Lock me down while I'm young, but I'm livin' my life
Shawty I can't stop now, I'm on the run
This is not the end, we can still be friends
Just as long as you understand that you can't
Yeezy season approaching
Fuck whatever y'all been hearing
Fuck what, fuck whatever y'all been wearing
The monster about to come alive again
Soon as I pull up and park the Benz
We get this bitch shaking like Parkinsons
Take my number and lock it in
Indian hair, no moccasins
It's too many hoes in this house of sin
Real nigga back in the house again
Black Timbs all on your couch again
Black dick all in your spouse again
And I know she like chocolate men
She got more niggas off than Cochran (Huh)

[Mike Shinoda]
(Get 'em Jay)
Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Yeah hearin me rap is like hearin G. Rap in his prime, I'm
Young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
'Bout to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? (Yep, yep)
Grand openin, grand closin
God damn your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him with no pen
Just draw off inspira- (-tion-tion)
Soon you gon' see you can't replace (him him)
With cheap imitations for these generations!
What the hell are you waiting for?
I'm just a picture in a frame
I paint word pictures on the canvas of life
But I don't control the colors
Yo, I'm ten steps ahead of niggas, that shit scary
Sometimes I feel ahead of myself
I hear this voice in the back of my mind
Like ""Mac maintain, just grind, dog, better yourself""
So what I do? I take heed and pick up the pace
Can't explain it when I pick up my son and look at my face
I'm like a black rose growin' in the concrete crackin' the pavement
There that voice go again ""Mac practice for greatness
Get paid for them immaculate statements""
Keep thinkin of them hot lines, like a physic, I can't explain it
There's no pen when I write it, it's nothing like it
God damn, what you want from me, what you want me to tell you huh?
Niggas thought that I would stutter huh, thought I was dumb
But I ain't used to use my mind, I used to just use my 9
And run wild with my boys, in the streets wild with these wars
Now the Qu'ran and 48 laws, they polish my flaws
I'm moving niggas like puppets with no strings attached
It's nothin' for Beans, so you know it ain't a thing for Mac
To look in your eyes, see through your heart, know what you fearin'
Pick you apart, like you niggas is transparent
(I see right through you niggas)
It's like Mac was born with advanced parents

Nothing is stopping you
skrrt skrrt

I know I'mma get it, I just don't know how
Heart up on the stage, body in the crowd
Parents always tried to keep me home
But I can't get paid from the crib, so I'll be gone 'til we on
What's up, Finally Famous
I had it on my jacket way back in high school
Know I wanted to be in them night clubs and not all off in that night school
So me and my niggas real life'd it, every week we did them cyphers
At the radio, had a crazy flow, man the city ain't heard shit like this
I woke up early on a Saturday
Said I'mma cash my check and hit some ass today
Hit the bank, my nigga called me like: ""Go rap for Ye
He at the station, rap that shit that you rap everyday""
Man, that shit sounds stupid
Then I hung up on his ass, then called him back like ""Fuck, let's do it""
I didn't even cash my check, man can't believe my ass pursued it
I didn't even have no gas but somehow God just lead me to it
Like, ""Let's do it""
[Interlude: Kanye West and DJ Mo Beatz]
When I heard the songs he was doing
Man, I knew he had to be on G.O.O.D Music
(BIG! SEAN!) (x5)
Just to think, last night I was in Venice hugging bitches,
Thanking God Almighty, condoms were invented
Cause I had a yellow bone that could've come from out the Simpsons
Man. who claim she never did it (Yeah right)
But under these conditions, she was with it
Then I hopped up on that red eye when I finished
I been gone for five hours, fuck, my head still spinning
Fucked the hotel up, shit she probably still in it
Getting rest that I be missing
But fuck it I'm on a mission
Flight delayed like 30 minutes, now that's the shit that I hate
Now it's eight thirty, I'm officially late, for that eight o'clock spot
Hey were actually
Just doing the intro for now
And then we'll do the verses secondly
skrrt skrrt
When I had my accident
I found out at that moment
Nothing is life
Is promised except death
If you had the opportunity
To play this game of life
You need to appreciate every moment
A lot of people
Don't appreciate there moment
Until it's passed
I know that it's painfully honest
But take it real slow
Guarantee nothing's promised
People turn cold
At the moment of the solace but
Nothing's ever promised (x4)
Take it real slow
I guarantee nothing's promised
SATURNiNE is a classic for the decade
Welcome to my forever
I'm coming to fade logic
And any other artist
That are big now
All disrespect
Tell kendrick that I need my crown
Back by tomorrow at 10
I'll do whatever to be heard
Yeah for sure
I can't even pretend
Because the music
Is my only spare direction to vent
Quite alone in this world
All my family left
Way faster than the speed of an equestrian
If there's a door for opportunity
I'm busting it in
Wait no
Another silly rapper wanting promos
But I'm hungrier than ever
Go and sponsor me to quiznos
And when it comes to the wackness
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Not a minute more
Not a second more
Not infinite though
Watchu waitin for?
Never nah, no, say
Takin off time
Takin off day
Whatchu fightin for?
When yo booty flow
Who that known it though
Whatchu waitin for?
If you runnin from love
You love her like that
You runnin' from nuns
She running right back
Because it's
And I'm on a road
And I'm backin? No
To love you no more
To look back and forth
Till you got it from the
You got it what what
Baba ba ba baa
One a 44
Till I'm on the road
Till you (?) know

20 plus years of selling Johnson & Johnson
I started out as a baby face monster
No wonder there's diaper rash on my conscience
My teething ring was numbed by the nonsense
Gem Star razor and a dinner plate
Arm & Hammer and a Mason jar, that's my dinner date
Then crack the window in the kitchen, let it ventilate
Cause I let it sizzle on the stove like a minute steak
Nigga, I was crack in the school zone
Two beepers on me, Starter jacket that was two-toned
Four lockers, four different bitches got their mule on
Black Ferris Bueller, cutting school with his jewels on
Couldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and a arm full of watches
What I sell for pain in the hood, I'm a doctor
Zhivago tried to fight the urge like Ivan Drago, if he dies he dies
Like Doughboy to Tre, if he rides he rides
Throwing punches in his room, if he cries he cries
We don't drink away the pain, when a nigga die
We add a link to the chain, inscribe a nigga name in your flesh
We playing on a higher game of chess
Once you delegate his bills, who gon' fuck his bitch the best?
A million megapixels of the Pyrex
Started on the scale digital, my only Timex
Nigga, this is timeless, simply cause it's honest
Pure as the fumes that be fucking with my sinus
Nigga this is Simon says, Simon red
Blood on your diamonds till you dying – dead, yuugh!

""You better change what comes out your speaker""
[Verso 1]
Llevo aquí como desde las 10
Tengo el 36 y van por el 3 tu
Entre la doña y yo esa no para de hablar
Como si toda la oficina quisiera escuchar
Bostezo, me estiro, me viro, te miro, sonrió
Me enderezo y luego bostezaste
Estiras, me miras, sonríes, bajas la vista y te viras
Se repite una y otra vez el ritual
Cada segundo lo hace más natural
El que me rose tu mano ya es algo tan habitual
Y las ganas de que me hables han hecho un festival
En…mi cabeza pero puede pasar
Que sea tu voz tan dulce como la puedo imaginar
Y que detrás de tu sonrisa este el mar
Que yo me quiera bañar en él y me dejes nadar
[Coro]
Si tienes nombre tienes un número y yo no debería marcar
Sin pronunciarte puedo pensar que te soñé así te puedo olvidar
Yo tengo ya un firma tallada en el corazón que no quisiera manchar
Si me das nombre te digo el número y yo sé lo que podría pasar
[Verso 2]
Lo sabía que sería melodía tu voz
Que seguiría yo en pos de mas
Que la primera palabra fugaz
Me saco del tumulto
Se alejaron las quejas y los insultos
De mi se escucha de la doña a la roña
Porque abriste la boca y ahora es mi turno me toca
Decirte algo lo que sea pero con cuidado
Si no dirijo mi vela quedo encallado
En el medio de la mar, que bien se había
Escondido detrás de tu sonrisa tu sol de medio día

I bet I can't get down to them (I can't fear nobody)
That tender lovin' so lovely (I can't hear nobody)
That tender lovin' so lovely (I can't see nobody)

Oh the rain, rain, the rain (Can't compete with nobody)
Oh sunshine (Nobody)

I brought my shotty right up in the party
No bodyguard, just see the squad and me
What's in my pockets? I brought Ben Franklin with me
What's in my house? 7,000 square feet
My bank account? I swear it's no telling
All type of amounts, just so I can spend it
What's all around? Fake niggas actin' friendly
Cause I'm on now, gotta keep it near me
Cause niggas will smile, but really be frienemy
Bitches all act down, but really ain't into me
They just want my account, heard I got them milli's
Can't go like that now, I'ma keep it pimpin'
Pistols all around, opp tryna' catch me slippin'
'Member my mama used to whip me
Now I can buy her ass anything

Apocalyptic, I pop biscuits (apocalypse), my bitch is topless
Not too excited I skeet skeet my own boxes
Drama King got the drama goods (bluh, bluh, bluh!)
Same place as the Domin' Osama Hood
Shoot up the thug and still puttin' the dame on it
The pimps had to give me a cup wit my name on it
I was ""Gordito""
I'm still Gordo or ""Gito""
Still know how to get the raw dough for cheap-o (cheap)
I'm lastin' all palm wit the connect of a ""perico"" (parakeet)
N.O.R.E. got no manners (no manners!)
I take a picture of ya ""culo"" wit the phone cameras
Go into ya own banners (ha!), they say my ballin' so hot like lone candles
And port or part of Santiago wit my own hammers (oh!)
[Left Gunz] Believe me when I say (oh!)

Everything's gonna be alright

Hey hombre I'm ""Ye"" so you too low
Money felt like sumo's so haters just gonna sue mo'
What you think gonna happen when they see me in that two do'
She gonna be with you she gonna see me she read' to go
Cause you have re-freshened me I'm fresh head to toe
So let's go let's get let's get it hey
I know you need something different trying to get away
I use that as a segue
Let's hit a spot where they only speak Reggae
Like no one can do it this long
She said ""aye Kan, who you tryin' to be, Akon?""
Sorry the drink had me wildin' a little bit
But my link had me stylin' a little bit
I think I'm gonna hit the island in a bit
But what I said had you smiling didn't it
She laughed at this
But after this
You know I gotta take that off
Young Halle told me ""make me feel good""
So I gave her the Monster Balls
I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better

Uhm, well cutie, I like your bougie booty 
Come Erykah Badu me, well, let's make a movie 
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler 
I show you the ropes, connect the dots 
A country girl that love Hollywood 
Mama used to cook red beans and rice 
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite 
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection 
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians 
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers 
Music and iPhone cameras 
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think 
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean 
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class 
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag 
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math? 
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck 
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper 
I said baby, spin that round and say the alphabet backwards 
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence 
Just cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is 
The head still good though, the head still good though 
Make me say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"" 
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical 
Make me get spiritual 
Make me believe in miracles, Buddhist monks and Captain Crunch cereal 
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me 
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday 
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place 
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek 
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee 
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets 
Then my shoe released, she was kicking in gratuity 
And yeah G, I was all for it

Breakneck speeds, passenger seat something pretty 
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place 
Second class bitches wouldn't let me on first base 
A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds 
And the Louis Vuitton store, got all of my pay stubs 
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous 
When did I become A list? I wasn't even on a list

Five rounds or mo'

Okay one more for me)

Hits model chicks without the bread 
Moet bottles flip, I'm out my head

Okay no more for me 
Fuck it, one more for me 
Send another round around for all my Gs 
Quarterback in the streets 
Throw a zip for three 
Mr. MC on the beats that still spin when I freeze 
In the city by the sea, bitch 
Feel the breeze 
Hot head, I got steel to squeeze 
See easy

The west is on my back, K. West is on the track
'kay? 
Now we fiend to get it jumpin' like the jacks 
Dimes and hoodrats, get down on the flo'
And pop that ass 'til it's time to go 
Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers' cards?
'Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fuckin' soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm prayin' to my Glock and my carbon
I sit back and read like Cat in the Hat

21 Savage not Boyz N The Hood
But I pull up on you, shoot your ass in the back
Stuart Little, heard these niggas some rats
Pockets full of cheese, bitch I got racks
I'm a real street nigga, bitch
I am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax
Pussy niggas love sneak dissin'
'Til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house
Keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar
Thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playin' Nintendo
I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade I got caught with a pistol, sent me to Panthersville
Eighth grade started playin' football
Then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade I was knocking niggas out
Nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward nigga, 2016
And I'm screaming fuck a deal
Bad bitch with me, she so thick
I don't even need a pill
I listen to your raps, thought you was hard
You ain't even street for real
Niggas love sneak dissin' on Twitter
They don't want beef for real
And all these niggas play like they tough
'Til a nigga get killed
'Til a nigga get spilled, 'til your blood get spilled
I'ma at your favorite rapper, shoot him like I'm John Dill'
""I been with you since day one
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Colosseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rolling in the Rolls Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I’m hiding from police
Cocaine seats, all white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic, I’m wondering if a thug’s prayers reach
Is Pious pious cause God loves pious?
Socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek?
All for Plato, screech
I’m out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy he laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats, preach
[Bridge: The-Dream]
La-Da-Da-Da
Wait till you get up off of my dick
Funny how the world wanna flip on death
We breathe it in every breath, so what's next?
All humans really wanna do is survive, get high, get fucked up and have sex
I take a breath of fresh and settle debts
People will whistle your praises when you're hot as the kettle gets
Selfish genes we wear like Levi's, Mr. Dawkins taught it
Got sweated at Lincoln Middle School in the principle's office
For chewing gum and something like, huh, horsing around
They was on they high horse. Teachers taught every course with a frown
They tossed me around like a cross with a crown
Asking questions about Jesus. Are his bones really lost in the ground?
I ask myself often, do I perpetrate a man..
Who doesn't know the meaning of life and only understands the false equations appearing real
Do I detest, am I shark who's just fishing
I just want a voice so somebody can listen
I accomplished that mission
So I'll wait patiently for people to catch what they missing
The labels they gave us we kept and then complain
About the injustice and the pain, that's insane
I wanna know why they hire dangerous people to be officers
To kill people and justify what the law confirms
Why the pattern of murders being the same tone
Zuckerburg and friends getting billions off our brains alone
Same thing with the food and the tobacco and entertainment
Bumping Edutainment, KRS had me askin where my brain went
You ask these rappers to recite a KRS ONE line they freeze up like stickups from the one time
I try to keep it simple, for cats who wanna know
XXXIX
The 39 is divine to the climb and I can't wait to show you what's next
But it ain't about me it's about us
We got let each other live
skrrt skrrt

I feel like Amber Rose still owe me sex (Chiraq)

Not really, but somewhat famous (err, kinda)
All I do is get tattoos and read French Vague
Every bitch in the spot wanna drink my Ragu
Who am I remind you? (What?)
But tell me, who am I to remind you? (Who am I?)
And did you know that the country, Switzerland
It was famous for lakes?

Man I can understand how it might be kind of hard to love a girl like me. I don't blame you much for wanting to be free. I just wanted you to know

I made that bitch famous (swa)
*We're going to skate to one song...one song only*

Even in prison I'm still the shit
Better recognize King in the building bitch
Act like you know you serious, I (ball so hard)
My ankle hurt, don't buy a car if I ain't the first
In the country with a 1, 2, 3 bitch
You watch me while I painted her, I (Ball so hard)

You know I (ball so hard), TIP is scary
Merci beaucoup in Paris

Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
I'm gonna blow your mind, hold you close
Squeeze you tight, the next time that I see you
I'm gonna tell you I love you, cross my heart
And I hope I die
The next time that I see you
I grew up, talking Chi-town slang
Never played soccer but loved to kick game
Loved chicks with thick frames
And big-lipped dames
Might see 'em on my arm
Cause I charm like thick chains
I was at the Knicks game, they were playing the Nets
Courtside so I could hear the shit they say to the refs
Thugs, this type of stuff you can't express in a text
See the section of girls who be dressing for checks
That's when she stepped in front of me
Light-skinned, long hair like a school days wannabe
A big 'ol (whoo) let's just say she was blessed
She had got it from her mama, God gave her the rest
We was being introduced by mutual friends
Like Kobe in the 4th, that's when the game begins
Game begins, games begins
I'm from the windy city, so I play to win
[JC] When your debut album, “The College Dropout” came out, the thing that people began to associate with you besides music was: Here's someone who's going to argue for his place in history; like, “Why am I not getting five stars?”
[KW] I think you got to make your case. Seventh grade, I wanted to be on the basketball team. I didn't get on the team, so that summer I practiced. I was on the summer league. My team won the championship; I was the point guard. And then when I went for eighth grade, I practiced and I hit every free throw, every layup, and the next day I looked on this chart, and my name wasn't on it. I asked the coach what's up, and they were like, “You're just not on it.” I was like, “But I hit every shot.” The next year — I was on the junior team when I was a freshman, that's how good I was. But I wasn't on my eighth-grade team, because some coach — some Grammy, some reviewer, some fashion person, some blah blah blah — they're all the same as that coach. Where I didn't feel that I had a position in eighth grade to scream and say, “Because I hit every one of my shots, I deserve to be on this team!” I'm letting it out on everybody who doesn't want to give me my credit.
[JC] And you know you hit your shots.
[KW] Yeah — you put me on the team. So I'm going to use my platform to tell people that they're not being fair. Anytime I've had a big thing that's ever pierced and cut across the Internet, it was a fight for justice. Justice. And when you say justice, it doesn't have to be war. Justice could just be clearing a path for people to dream properly. It could be clearing a path to make it fair within the arena that I play. You know, if Michael Jordan can scream at the refs, me as Kanye West, as the Michael Jordan of music, can go and say, “This is wrong.”
[JC] You've won a lot of Grammys.
[KW]“[My Beautiful] Dark [Twisted] Fantasy” and “Watch the Throne”: neither was nominated for Album of the Year, and I made both of those in one year. I don't know if this is statistically right, but I'm assuming I have the most Grammys of anyone my age, but I haven't won one against a white person.
But the thing is, I don't care about the Grammys; I just would like for the statistics to be more accurate.
[JC] You want the historical record to be right.
[KW] Yeah, I don't want them to rewrite history right in front of us. At least, not on my clock. I really appreciate the moments that I was able to win rap album of the year or whatever. But after a while, it's like: “Wait a second; this isn't fair. This is a setup.” I remember when both Gnarls Barkley and Justin [Timberlake] lost for Album of the Year, and I looked at Justin, and I was like: “Do you want me to go onstage for you? You know, do you want me to fight” —
[JC] For you.
[KW] For what's right. I am so credible and so influential and so relevant that I will change things. So when the next little girl that wants to be, you know, a musician and give up her anonymity and her voice to express her talent and bring something special to the world, and it's time for us to roll out and say, “Did this person have the biggest thing of the year?” — that thing is more fair because I was there.
[JC] But has that instinct led you astray? Like the Taylor Swift interruption at the MTV Video Music Awards, things like that.
[KW] It's only led me to complete awesomeness at all times. It's only led me to awesome truth and awesomeness. Beauty, truth, awesomeness. That's all it is.
[JC] So no regrets?
[KW] I don't have one regret.
[JC] Do you believe in the concept of regret?
[KW] If anyone's reading this waiting for some type of full-on, flat apology for anything, they should just stop reading right now.
[JC] But that is something that you apologized for.
[KW] Yeah, I think that I have like, faltered, you know, as a human. My message isn't perfectly defined. I have, as a human being, fallen to peer pressure.
[JC] That's fascinating, to look at that record through that lens.
[KW] I don't have some type of romantic relationship with the public. I'm like, the anti-celebrity, and my music comes from a place of being anti. That was the album where I gave people what they wanted. I don't think that at that point, with my relationship with the public and with skeptical buyers, that I could've done “Black Skinhead” [from “Yeezus]
[JC] Does that make “Dark Fantasy” a dishonest album in some way?
[KW] It's always going to be 80 percent, at least, what I want to give, and 20 percent fulfilling a perception. If you walk into an old man's house, they're not giving nothing. They're at 100 percent exactly what they want to do. I would hear stories about Steve Jobs and feel like he was at 100 percent exactly what he wanted to do, but I'm sure even a Steve Jobs has compromised. Even a Rick Owens has compromised. You know, even a Kanye West has compromised. Sometimes you don't even know when you're being compromised till after the fact, and that's what you regret.
I don't want to come off dissing “Dark Fantasy.” It's me never being satisfied and then me coming and admitting and saying the truth. As much as I can air things out for other people, to air things out for myself, to say, “I feel like this could've been stronger.”
[JC] Even though you had always wanted to be out in front, was there ever a point where you valued your anonymity?
[KW] Yeah, I held on to the last moments of it. I knew when I wrote the line “light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson” [from the song “Slow Jamz""] I was going to be a big star. At the time, they used to have the Virgin music [stores], and I would go there and just go up the escalator and say to myself, “I'm soaking in these last moments of anonymity.” I knew I was going to make it this far; I knew that this was going to happen.

Hold the rosary, [?] stay close to me
Know I got a long road ahead of me
Go ahead, do your worst, it's only gonna better me
Got a girl head between my legs like a pedigree
It's easy just to let her leave, all I need is 88 keys just to breathe
But that is not an option
So while these rappers have their notepads and they're jotting
I'm bringing steady jogging, remembering the worst days
Lonely-ass birthdays, everybody want to see tomorrow like it's Thursday
I heard they was looking for a savior
I'm Jesus with a little bit of gold and a pager
We know that we major whole different stage, this is stadium status
Still can't believe they laughed at us
And now they laugh with us
And they ass-backwards
You know I'm that nigga

I'm the last hope, so I guess I am well
The Obama of this shit, I hope I prevail

And I'll never let my son have an ego 
He'll be nice to everyone, wherever we go 
I mean I might even make him be Republican 
So everybody know he love white people 
And I'll never let him leave his college girlfriend 
And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind 
And I'll never let him ever hit the telethon 
I mean even if people dyin' and the world ends 
See, I just want him to have an easy life, not like Yeezy life 
Just want him to be someone people like 
Don't want him to be hated all the time, judged 
Don't be like your daddy that would never budge 
And I'll never let him ever hit a strip club 
I learned the hard way, that ain't the place to get love 
And I'll never let his mom move to LA 
Knowin' she couldn't take the pressure now we all pray 
Jay-Z and Nina Simone:

Bally silts, Kangol tilts
Stand straight when the boss talkin, hush yo lips
My affiliates contract hits
I let the street declare war when you want that beef
Talk cheap, get money, I was taught to ride
Loyalty came first and we don't switch no sides
I'ma savage on the block, nickel rocks and heroin hopes
I walked the ghetto like them but I was takin' my notes
Certified goon, the locks on standby
I just need a couple real niggas I can stand by (C.M.B.)
A bad bitch with hips and two niggas on the interstate takin' them trips
I'm into carrots like Bugs Bunny, Young Brisco, the New Cash Money
skrrt skrrt
Reportin' live from the booth
I'm killin' these bitches, Young Wayne Carruth
Untamed and loose, plus drank and juice
I was once a spark, into a flame it grew
I don't complain to you, don't complain to me
Everbody got beef and I just came to eat
I'm in the game for keeps, if you in my lane I beep
I been runnin this shit and I ain't neva sprained my knee
And guess who came home, Ronnie the O.G

Couple of the feds say I'm insane
A psych said.....
And then his son told me put down the drink dawg
I got a...
I guess... finna chop it's head off
I need a little something to knock the edge off
Aside from this song, life sucks
....modest
And every good god needs a goddess
And every good star couldn't guide us
It falls upon something that's inside us
So I.... with my riders
...Riders
I don't like them, they don't like that
They don't like that, I don't want that 
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again 
Don't worry about me, worry about you
Worry about something, don't worry what I do
Hating motherfuckers, it'll be a long time
Before you ever see me again, me again 
See I need some time to meditate 
Naw bitch I'm fly I need time to levitate 
And I don't sound....trying to hesitate 
.... like nigga, you a featherweight
And I'm a heavyweight and I'm very great 
I put in every date, rocking in every state
Do not debate, you cannot cape 
I must... 
Guess its my fate, guess it was written 
I can... guess it was different 
...back then I was different 
Now I'm spitting and everybody's just spitting
And what it sound like when everybody sound like
What you sound like, bumpin' 'em on a round mic 
I don't need... 
Feel like... 
And these niggas are secondary like Pippen around Mike 
Trippin' around sight, something on that down light 
I'mma be down, right, when you niggas is downright biters 
And my shit downright fire, from the corner buyer 
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout them, don't worry 'bout you, and what you gonna do
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout you and baby I do
Don't worry bout something else we can't do

It'll be a long time before you ever see me again

And I'm gonna show you what I'm gonna do again 
skrrt skrrt
Need you to clap your hands, hands (x7) 
So the song like a Section 8 
So I pass that dick around like the collection plate 
I can sell 'em on Sunday ...with the... 
I be stunting with the stunnas, and that's the best you make 
So if everybody is sad now, and shit don't pan out 
Throw your hands up, at least give them a handout 
....this song is like Jerome is 
....on the cellphone days, I'm homeless 
Or feeling like Ike at the end of the movie 
When you wait another two shows just to get to me

Yo, first I snatched the streets then I snatched the charts
First I had they ear, now I have their heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the rovers roll up wit ribbons
I seen them repo'd, resold then redriven
So when I reload, he holds number one position
When you hot I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzelin'
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
'cause I'm a be that nigga for life
This is not an image, this is God given
This is hard livin', mixed with cristal sippin'
It's the most consistent, Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordan of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
skrrt skrrt
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggaz can't make it to ballads to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership
Swear I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racisms still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even make me show I.D to get inside of Sam's club
I done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized each 3 or 4 times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
Its goin' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl's father past away
So I promised to Mr. Rany I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah, now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watchin' me from the other side

I used to be in gym class like ""Nigga, I'm finna be a rapper""
I didn't do my homework for my last three years of high school, nigga
So I'm assuming ya'll niggas don't know what you doing
You're not hot cause your tapes don't work
We can't stop, our brakes don't work
Man I heard you spit your favorite verse
It's the softest place on Earth
Ya'll some motherfucking idiots
Dropping enough bricks to build a city with
What the fuck is on your mind?
You sniffing that shit
My own blood, go on stud
Probably the reason that the phone bugged
Always talking fast as hell like Bone Thugs
You act like you don't know what the chrome does
Like what 2 shots to the dome does
Plus you kind of slow man
But if we listen to you
We all be broke like Gary Coleman
I'm trying to blow like Pokémane
And I don't want to have to choke you man
I'd rather go to bed, getting head on the sofa man
Yo but, aigh, it's over man

And if you don't then you prolly wont
Sissy niggaz call em maricon
skrrt skrrt
I guess its all jokes for niggas that's lost hope
Dealing with a system made for keeping us all broke
Enough Said
Who Wants to think about bus fare?
Grow up in the hood you can see that its unfair
Cuz daddy a Criminal, and mom in the living room
Belt on her arm, shooting up with them Chemicals
And love don't live here, and love ain't sincere
The thugs they live, and drugs they deal here
The walls they built for us is keeping us locked in
T.v. screens to keep us mentality boxed in
And god Damn!
You think he worried bouta bus pass?
When he reminiscing on the times he use to cut class
Trynna be the man on the street
Hunnid grand on the street
Til life hit, now he is the man on the street
Yeah the Irony is nobody is hiring
Posted on the block, the same places my flyers be
Looking at the pictures and wishing he was as fly as me
Never had had a dream so his only hope is the lottery
Take a look at society
Perfect structural modeling
Taking the nigga out of me
Might just work
Niggas thinkin ""Damn nigga how you write this verse?""
But look that's what happens when I light this Purp
Cuz look
skrrt skrrt

Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson
Benevolent is in the building
Only problem is he on top of the ceiling
Cause y'all said that he killing
Even Rogue from X-Men said that she feel him
But she ain't phase me, there's to much accounted for
I been dealing with more bull than a matador
Sorry competition, I'm way out of your
League, please stay in the dugout, what you batting for?
Nope nobody's on one, Look up at the bases and everybody's on one
And I'm about to hit a home run, You'll even want to be a member when the song's done, (Boy Brigade)
Click onto my page right after my name says, (Boy Brigade)
I think I got to change it up so, Sorry Kanye
Pick 5 MCs, make sure they sounding sick
Cause if you give me a shot, I'll run around your picks
Like Richard Hamilton, if you try to challenge him
Him meaning me, then I'll make sure I damage him
Him meaning you, what is up? what it do?
And I'm becoming one, so you're becoming two
And wherever I go, you'll be coming too
Now that you've lost your spot, you have nothing else to do
Man I used to front a lot just to fit in
Then I realized, why try to be different
Flow's copy written, cause you copy my writtens
I can't believe this cat, so you got to be kitten
All you say is ""Purr"", ""Meow""
Cause that ain't writer's block, you're burnt out
Let me get straight to the point like a bird's mouth
You are playing with a king like Varejao
(Nigga, uh)
Yeah, huh (nigga uh)
Why don't ya'll take a look into my life?
See what I see
(Nigga uh, nigga, nigga, nigga uh)
At the age of fourteen, introduced to coupes
Learnin' how to seduce niggas takin' they loot
Quickly, got involved with this money lifestyle
The finer things, all kinda things, power, money
Cars and diamond rings, in 9th grade flauntin'
The Gucci boots with the G's on it
A high price for this 'high price' life
While I'm on tour is my man cheatin' just for spite?
And if you only knew I hold my minks at nights with cheap
Or no other hands can hold me right
My girls ain't the same, guess it's cuz the fame
Bitches smile in my face and throw dirt on my name
Mad cuz I made it, now friends intimidated
Hate it that I'm in the same game as them
With mo' fame than them, they know who they are
This life is no joke, got us havin' to broke
You was my sister, we used to dream together
How we could make it real big, do our thing together
Huh, Thelma & Louise together, remember them days?
Them niggas we played? Now we don't even speak
Went our seperate ways, seperate lives
Lost friendship for pride, playin' the game
About to forfeit high price life, I can't afford it
1 - My life, do ya feel what I feel?
My life, a black girl's ordeal my life
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
My life
Do ya'll know what it feels like?
Do ya'll know what it be like?
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Daddy's girl, in his wildest dreams
Said he think that lil' Ing will be illest in this rap-thing
My funny Valentine
Sweet, comic Valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art
Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?
Don't change a hair for me
All the bottle poppin'. Patron we rockin
Uh uh uh uh yeah
Me and Cass got flows until the beat run out
I told you motherfuckers before we in the house
And we standin on the couch
With my drink and my two step my drink and my two step
Three glasses in a row you start to think I was Q-Tip
Bartender pour a round I took a few sips
Stumblin', fallin' down, I ain't drunk that's my new step
Now why would I listen to bullshit they shovel
When they taste level ain't at my waist level
I'm fly get on a plane jet lagged already
I'm tired, the Goyard bags is heavy
I'm fire, the flow hard as a Chevy
I told her me like ye, she said she like me, ha
When see me with a CL like Pete Rock
She just wanna grab a microphone and beat box
Even in high school I was always a special kid
First pack of condoms I asked for extra big
Now I got a flow they sit me right next to Big
And all these old rappers don't know where the exit is
But but but no buts nigga
What nigga
We fired motherfuckers, Donald Trump nigga
I'm killin' these niggas can't front nigga
Now let's drink to that until drunk nigga
I got my drink and my two step
skrrt skrrt
Got my drink and my two step
skrrt skrrt
It's on, it's on, it's on and I'm home
Get the patron and tell them that it's on
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
And I'm home get the patron and tell them that it's on
Could be lookin’ at you
skrrt skrrt
If you’d handled what I’d taken
skrrt skrrt
No fine line, don’t have to be dead right
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I’m Francis
Still dreamin’ of a glory
Of somethin’ new
I can’t remember what it’s like
skrrt skrrt
It’s all good though
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Don’t wanna know if you made mistakes
Your my devil your my angel,
Your my heaven your my hell,
Your my now your my never,
Your my freedom your my jail,
Your my lies your my truth,
Your my war your my truce,
Your my questions your my proof,
Your stress and your my masseuse,
Mama say mama say momma Dondas' son,
Lost in this plastic life,
Lets break out of this fake ass party and turn this into a classic night,
If we die in each others arms,
We'll still get laid in the after-life,
If we die in each others arms we'll still get laid.
Chain Heavy / Sweat off My Face
My chain heavy yeah yeah my chain heavy, my chain heavy, my chain too heavy [2x]
They try to tell me my chain broke the levy,
Maybe cuz its flooded,
Why you walkin' round with a baby cross his cousin,
My teeth already white yall gone make me floss for nothing,
My teeth real diamonds what's the cause of the frontin',
While yall got all caps on?,
Don Cheadle Time,
Get extra black on em',
Burn Hollywood burn,
Take too long for the homies to get their turn,
Probably be cremated before I get my urn,
They try to tell that aliens built the pyramids,
I swear life's a bitch on a period,
For every instant cuz every hoe thinks you see,
Kanye West's 35-minute super-video, Runaway, peaks with a parade. Fireworks flash while red hoods march through a field. At the center of the spectacle is a huge, pale, cartoonish rendering of Michael Jackson's head. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy's gargantuan ""All of the Lights"" soundtracks the procession, with Kanye pleading, ""Something wrong, I hold my head/ MJ gone, our nigga dead."" The tribute marks another chapter in West's ongoing obsession with the King of Pop.
West's discography contains innumerable references and allusions to Jackson. His first hit as a producer, Jay-Z's ""Izzo (H.O.V.A.)"", sampled the Jackson 5's ""I Want You Back"". For many, his first memorable lines as a rapper came during 2003's ""Slow Jamz"": ""She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson/ Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson."" And when West's recent interview with Matt Lauer on the ""Today"" show went awry, he took to Twitter, writing, ""I wish Michael Jackson had twitter!!!!!! Maybe Mike could have explained how the media tried to set him up!!! It's all a fucking set up!!!!"" Like most everything else, Kanye may exaggerate the kinship, but it's real. And it's never more apparent than on Twisted Fantasy, a blast of surreal pop excess that few artists are capable of creating, or even willing to attempt.
To be clear, Kanye West is not Michael Jackson. As he told MTV last month, ""I do have a goal in this lifetime to be the greatest artist of all time, [but] that's very difficult being that I can't dance or sing."" He ended the thought with a laugh, but you get the impression he's not kidding. Unlike Michael, he's not interested in scrubbing away bits of himself-- his blackness, his candidness-- to appease the masses. And while Jackson's own twisted fantasies of paranoia and betrayal eventually consumed him whole, West is still aware of his illusions, though that mindfulness becomes increasingly unmoored with each newspaper-splashing controversy. The balance is tenuous, but right now it's working to his advantage. On Twisted Fantasy, Kanye is crazy enough to truly believe he's the greatest out there. And, about a decade into his career, the hardworking perfectionist has gained the talent on the mic and in the control room to make a startlingly strong case for just that.
Kanye's last album, 2008's 808s and Heartbreak, was heavy on the Auto-Tune and stark synths, but relatively light on grandiose ideas. It was a necessary detour that expanded his emotional palette; a bloodletting after a harsh breakup and the passing of his mother that manifests itself in Twisted Fantasy's harshest lows. But musically, the new album largely continues where 2007's Graduation left off in its maximalist hip-hop bent, with flashes of The College Dropout's comfort-food sampling and Late Registration's baroque instrumentation weaved in seamlessly. As a result, the record comes off like a culmination and an instant greatest hits, the ultimate realization of his strongest talents and divisive public persona. And since the nerd-superstar rap archetype he popularized has now become commonplace, he leaves it in the dust, taking his style and drama to previously uncharted locales, far away from typical civilization.
He's got a lot on his mind, too. After exiling himself for months following last year's infamous Taylor Swift stage bomb, the rapper made some of his first comeback appearances at the headquarters of Facebook and Twitter in late July. Videos of West standing on a table in tailored GQ duds while gesticulating through new rhymes (sans musical accompaniment) quickly made the rounds. The Silicon Valley visits seemed like a stunt, but they were prophetic. Forever an over-sharer, Kanye was looking for an outlet for his latest mirror-born musings. He found that platform with Twitter, and proceeded to dictate his own narrative in 140 character hits. Whether showing off exotic purchases, defending himself against the press, or going on stream-of-consciousness rants, Kanye finally had the middleman-free, instant-gratification platform he'd always wanted.
Juiced on the direct connection, he began releasing weekly songs for free online, the generosity of which would be moot if the songs didn't deliver. But they did, over and over, eventually building up the same type of superstar goodwill Radiohead pulled off with their pay-what-you-want In Rainbows release plan and Lil Wayne's free mixtape barrage leading up to 2008's Tha Carter III. So while Kanye can't sing or dance like Michael, he's making meaningful connections in a fresh, oftentimes (ahem) naked way. ""When I used to finish an album I would be so excited for my mom to hear the final - final!"" he wrote on November 11. ""The final - final is what we used to call the... completed album with all the skits!!! I made songs to please one person... MY MOM!!! I would think... would my my Mom like this song!""

skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Yes, ha ha ha
skrrt skrrt
Let's go, L.A.C
skrrt skrrt
My music, my life, my heart, my soul
My music, my everything, I give my all
My wife, my daughter, my love, my dream
My mother, my father, my brother, my team
My camp, my squad, my house, my car
My boat, my shoes, my pants, my shirt
My coke, my sugar, my cream, my butter
My toast, my all, my queen, my folks
My baby! Walk like six strings
Talk like she's my everything
My baby! Loves me, hates me
Leaves me, runs right back
That sexy lady! All I know
She shares all my confusion, so
My baby! Will not want for an-y-thing
I swear this though
[Knoc-Turn'al talking]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If Muzik should die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take
skrrt skrrt
[ ""Murder"" ]
Bloody murder, murder, murder
Paper read ""murder, black-on-black murder""
Paper read ""murder, black-on-black murder"" again
This is to the memory of Danroy Henry
Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
Strays from the same shade nigga, we on the same team
Giving you respect, I expect the same thing
All-black everything, nigga you know my fresh code
I’m out here fighting for you, don’t increase my stressload!
Niggas watching the throne, very happy to be you
Power to the people, when you see me, see you
skrrt skrrt
And I’m from the murder capital where they murder for capital
Heard about at least three killings this afternoon
Looking at the news like ""damn! I was just with him after school""
No shop class but half the school got a tool
And a ""I could die any day""-type attitude
Plus his little brother got shot repping his avenue
It’s time for us to stop and redefine black power
41 souls murdered in fifty hours
Is it genocide?
Cause I can still hear his mama cry
Know the family traumatized
Shots left holes in his face about piranha-sized
The old pastor closed the cold casket
And said the church ain’t got enough room for all the tombs
It’s a war going on outside we ain’t safe from
I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
314 soldiers died in Iraq, 509 died in Chicago
skrrt skrrt
I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died
Uh, real niggas just multiply
And they say by 21 I was supposed to die
So I’m out here celebrating my post-demise
If you put crabs in a barrel to ensure your survival
[Produced by Sevn Thomas and Kanye West]
Let me know if you're feelin' lonely
Cause ain't no real niggas out here
Ye what these niggas start hummin' out their mouth with?
Bunch of bullshit, weak ass albums
Bunch of lil' niggas tryna copy our style
When we originated this, whole mothafuckin' album had hits
That's why we up in the Ritz
That's why I'm up in your bitch, head honcho
Get you killed pronto, wearin' red now, El Segundo
Bail long as Alonzo Mourning
Kill a nigga in his Monte Carlo like Alonzo
Sold records, sold crack, nigga, recognize
For the record, I've been wreckin' shit since '05
No lie, J's on
skrrt skrrt
Rewind, J's on
skrrt skrrt
Yeezy, tell these niggas that they is slaves
Master want you on red carpet like yesterday
You a house nigga, I'ma get away though
Come back kill master ass like Django
Most you niggas just rapping for the fame though
I start rapping to get the fuck out this durango
What goes around comes around how that saying go?
Documentary 2, no 50 keep the change hoe
skrrt skrrt
Let me know if you're feelin' crazy
I guess all that stuff they told me
In my life was extra shady
I should've kept 'em waitin'
skrrt skrrt
I'm on top, no lie
skrrt skrrt
I'm on top, good night
skrrt skrrt
Back like I never left, nigga I'm on my second breath
And I got another track from Yeezy
skrrt skrrt
How'd you do that? Like Eric Wright said Eazy
[Game]
Pull up in my cool whip, I don't give a fuck about it
Leave it at the valet, I ain't fucked up about it
I'll call an Uber, nigga, I'll fuckin' shoot a nigga
I got a white bitch that blow like a tuba, nigga
I just got a new crib, I just got a new Wraith
I just got cooler than LL Cool J
I just got a new gun, squeeze it like some toothpaste
A'udhu Billahi min ash-shaytaan-i'r rajeem. Bismillah-i'r Rahman-i'r Raheem
Allahu Akbar (x4)
This is one's for all my brothers and sisters who died in Iraq, Israel, Afghanistan and right here in America
(Jesus Walks)
Abraham Taught
Muhammad Taught
And Moses split the sea
(Jesus Walk with me)
I ain't tryin' to profit off the prophets so this one's for free
G's up along with Muhammad and Jesus
In the Quran they call him Isa
Don't think Osama and Saddam is our leader
We pray for peace, but the drama intrigues us
All, so we fall for the illusions of the beast
So instead of tryin' to teach we show our teeth
Same God, different beliefs
Hijabs, Sunday clothes, yarmulke, kufi, same mission beneath
We all tryin' to get to where the sufferin' ends
In front of the Most High bein' judged for our sins
Can't front for the Most High, so the struggle
Continues
You, every bee, bird and tree, he, her and me
We virtually on the same boat
With the same goats, on the same sea
Tryin' to stay afloat, and put the devil in the yoke
With a couple of God's quotes
Ash-had an la ilaha illa llah
(Astaghfirullah)
And to the sisters and the mothers of ours
Who cover theyselves cause they're lovers of God
The Creator of the worlds, Sculptor of the stars
During Hajj, we walk, through Ramadaan, we starve
Though you not eatin', there's a feedin' of the mind
A defeatin' of the demons, a seein' of the signs
A leanin' on the lines from the surahs
Getting purer, God deemed it unclean
Bro. Bro. Listen to the kids. Jeremy, I need, I gotta put it down for a second. It's beautiful. Jeremy Scott's design.
First of all, thank you Taylor for being so gracious and giving me this award, this evening thank you. And I can think back to the first day I met you, also. You know. I think about, when I'm in the grocery store with my daughter, and I have a really great conversation about fresh juice and, you know. And at the end they say, ""Oh, you're not that bad after all."" And like, I think about it sometimes. Like, it crosses my mind a bit like when I go to a baseball game. And um, sixty thousand people boo me. Crosses my mind a little bit. And I think if I had to do it all again what would I have done?
Would I have worn a leather shirt? Would I have drank a half a bottle of Hennessy and gave the rest of it to the audience Y'all know y'all drink that bottle too. If I had a daughter at that time, would I have went on stage and grab the mic from someone else's? You know, this arena tomorrow, it's gonna be a completely different set up, some concert something like that. This stage will be gone, after that night, the stage is gone, but the effect that it had on people remain.
The, the problem was, the contradiction, the contradiction is, I do fight for artists, but in that fight I somehow, was disrespectful to artists. I-I didn't know how to say the right thing. The perfect thing. I just, I sat at the Grammy's and saw Justin Timberlake and Cee-Lo lose. Gnarls Barkley and the Future-Love... ""SexyBack"" album, and bro….Justin I ain't tryna put you on blast but I saw that man in tears, bro. You know, and I was thinking like, ""He deserve to win Album of the Year.""
And this small box that we are as the entertainers of the evening. How could you explain that? Sometimes I feel like, you know, all this shit they run about beef and that, sometimes I feel like I died for an artist's opinion, for an artist to be able to have an opinion after they were successful. I'm not no politician bro. And look at that, you know how many times MTV ran that footage again, cause it got them more ratings? You know how many times they announced Taylor was gonna give me the award, cause it got them more ratings? Listen to the kids bro!
Inhale and I want you to exhale
And I want you to follow your breath
I'm off on the adventure (We're good)
This here is dedicated to all of the kids like me
I'm on my way to heaven (Wherever you are, now)
Birds sing, flying around
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
You might hear the birds singing, flying around
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt

Woah now. Hey!
Mr. Rager, Mr. Rager
skrrt skrrt
I'm off on the adventure, Mr. Rager
Tell me some of your stories, tell us of your travels
Hey! Mr. Rager, Mr. Rager
skrrt skrrt
I'm on my way to heaven, Mr. Rager
Can we tag along, can we take the journey?
Knocked down, round for round
You're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)
When will the heaven begin? (Yeah)

skrrt skrrt
Hush now child and don't you cry
skrrt skrrt
Just move on up toward your destination
Though you may find, from time to time, complication
Bite your lip and take the trip
Though there may be wet road ahead
And you cannot slip
Just move on up for peace you will find
Into the steeple of beautiful people where there's only one kind
So hush now child and don't you cry
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Take a walk through my brain if you mind not the rain
See my dreams and flaws
See my best and my worst
Born in the cradle of the greats
Just like nasty nas, biggie, pun, cube and Pac
Grown man thoughts on my mind from the start
So I be out in the streets tryna tryna make a dollar outta 15 cents
But you know how hard on the streets shit gets
But I can't give up; I'm just tryna live up
Told my mama just chill, someday I will be king
So stay out my lane
I'm just tryna do my thing
My boys do whatever and however for the cheddar
The game is crazy but the money make it better
So we tryna get laid and we gotta get paid at the same damn time
What it do, what it is, nastyfel keep it gee
Cause i want a lotta cars; beemers, lamboghinis, bentleys, buggattis
I'm the nastyfel, I'm a man. I ain't perfect
skrrt skrrt
Yo Bump, I just want to make sure everybody knew who did the track

Give me that room
Don't make me up this 40 on me
And click ta clack boom!
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
See there, it ain't poppin' 'less we there
Your barkin' better stop before I hit you with the three squared
That's a nine if you failed math, I bail pass in that pale Jag
Cause I push weight and you sell bags
Come and cop that from me
My [diesel?] have cluckers noddin off like they ain't slept in weeks
Whoever disrespect the chief
I'll have the Tec put you pets to sleep
That's all you birds I catch singing to detects police
You ain't my dogs, you rats and you cats can rest in peace
I post up on a deck for weeks
You can ask K-West, I'm a [massive beast?]
I got a good name, and I spit good game
Tried ya baby mama out, and she got good brains
I look lames in the face and tell 'em
You ain't a Goon, you's a fruit, I'm a gansta mella
(Foxy) Gyeah
(Shyne) Gyeah, walk with me
(Foxy)
Gyeah, It's like New York's been soft
Ever since my nigga Shyne been sittin' in prison
skrrt skrrt
Check it, sick things, sick rings, this shit is sickening
Sick chains sick aim, 5th bang 5th frame
Bail money lawyers actin' funny when I come through
Hit 'em with a bundle on the humble
Couple notes, seen Boy George with a Rolls
Shit, I want one too
What the fuck I'm gon' do
But get it if it's there to be gotten 'til I'm dried and rotten
And I'm rockin' sideways muthafucka crime pays
I need it, I'll get it, I got it, I'll chop it, I'll double the profit
And bubble the pockets, I'm living to die
Niggas talk fly 'til I walk by and pop somethin'
Muthafuckas forgot somethin', I'm not frontin'
This ain't rap, music this ain't that
You fuck around I'll have you sleepin' where the saints at
Sincerely yours Shyne muthafuckin' Po
Bitch get yo' bags hit the muthafuckin' do'
May the angels walk with me, more or less
Big things, big rims nigga, more or less
Fuckin' big stars in big cars, more or less
I can say I seen it all and done it all, more or less
A G is a G, a ki is a ki, a snitch is a fish (as in kilo)
With no fins that can't swim when I dump him in the river
Charcoal gray R, 12 cylinders bulletproof sentences
Trial day tentative
[Rhymefest] + (Kanye)
Yeah, this joint right here man, is for all my blue collar niggas
In the Midwest goin through our struggle
We know things could be better, huh
And we just want a little mooore
No matter how much I get (I want mooore)
Even when I talk my shit (I want mooore)
Every party on every list
And everybody want a life like this
But still (I want more)
skrrt skrrt
Look.. now I ain't goin for the okey-doke (nope)
You owe me dough?, you better pay me like you know we broke
This industry be tryin to strangle niggas in the choke
You think these rappers rich? These niggas out here sellin dope
You think it's crazy sayin, ""If I had what he had""
But if you had what he had, nigga you'd be mad
Three kids, see dad broke-ass waitin on the royalties with no cash
Nice car, no gas, stuck at the pump
Had a lil' hot single now he's stuck in a slump
At the top of his section eight, straight waitin to jump
Like Milli Vanilli, now people just look at him silly
Sayin ""That's umm - I forgot his name - who is he?""
He wanted (mooore) never really thought of the loss
Lookin for (mooore) everybody playin the boss
To get (mooore) now he just stuck in the sauce
Like white kids when they got cut off, ""Daddy I want.."" (mooore)
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
This go out to every man tryin to achieve and hold his own
Them ladies are nice, but you gotta leave them hoes alone
skrrt skrrt
Yo the other day
Somebody was tryna tell me that
I guess rappers used to do this thing where
They put this thing called ""meaning""
In the words that they chose to use
Within their songs
And, I don't know man
I'm having a hard time believing them
I got my...
Headphones full of soul beats, deep into the moonlight
Translates to no sleep, tomorrow's now tonight
And my clock's a Rollie, I'm tryna set the mood right
Sometimes, my thoughts wanna start a food fight with me
Inspiration will come and go [In waves]
Don't get caught in its undertow [Behave]
Even though my high rise still a bungalow
Blistex on the lips, spittin' smoothly
Swallow Malibu, how are you, feelin' groovy
Indestructible, you can't do nothin' to me
Plottin' like a movie, jottin' on the loose leaf
Rockin' me a new flow, as sweet as glucose
Cook it all in front of you, serve ya'll like Sumo's
Pick it up like to-go, pick it up like jewfro
Stranded on my island, Robinson Crusoe
G to Tha C, you know, I'm 360
Iceman with mics, man, roll up with frees quickly
Lookin' pretty spiffy, and I do get mad props
Fetus to grandpops, game on padlock
Green Light District, throwback, can't stop
I was in the studio while you was buyin' Black Ops
Still up in the studio while you was buyin' Black Ops
Bon Iver: 
I shoot the lights out 
Hide till it's bright out 
Whoa, just another lonely night 
Are you willing to sacrifice your life? 
Rick Ross: 
Bitch, I'm a monster, no good blood sucker

Oh, the best living or dead hands down, huh? 
Less talk more head right now, huh? 
And my eyes more red than the devil is 
And I'm bout to take it to another level bitch 
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this 
Do the rap and the track, triple double no assist 
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit 
Argue with my older bitch acting like I owe her shit 
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain 
Bought the chain that always give me back pain 
Fuckin up my money so, yeh, I had to act sane 
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent 
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial 
If you wanna make your number one your number two now 
This that goose and malibu, I call it Malibooyah"" 
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit em with the new style 
Throw that motherfucker, ""Well, whatchu gon' do now? 
Whatever ever I wanna do, gosh it's cool now"" 
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now 
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out 
'Cause you will never get on top of this 
So mommy best advice is just to get on top of this 
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh? 
I put the pussy in a sarcophagus 
Now she claiming that I bruise her esophagus 
Head of the class and she just want a swallowship 
I'm living the future so the present is my past 
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

Question, what do these things all have in common? 
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster 
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense 
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is 
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen 
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams 
skrrt skrrt

I love my women real tall, ayy
Type that can really play ball, ayy
You buy my hat at the park, ayy
Think I might really play ball, ayy
I got a link in my bio
My bitch do the salsa like pico de gallo
They gotta ask if they may, Cinco de Mayo
How can they call themselves bosses
When they got so many bosses
You gotta see what your boss say
I get it straight out the faucet
I ain't felt like this since the third Drought, third Carter drop
Told my momma third grade I'd be in the third Barbershop
And yeah, my momma got real worried when she heard college drop
But now I call the shots
[Segue]
Bad little mama, she gettin' it Obama

I've been a very good sport, haven't I, this year
Like a mama you birthed me, Brooklyn you nursed me
Schooled me with hard knocks, better than Burkley
They say you murked me by the time I was 21
That shit disturbed me, but you never hurt me
Hello Brooklyn, if we had a daughter
Guess what I'm a call her, Brooklyn Carter
When I left you for Virginia it didn't offend ya
Cause you know I only stepped out to get dinner

Say Ooh it's something about
Kinda woman that wants you but don't need you
Hey I can't figure it out
skrrt skrrt
Cause she walk like a boss, talk like a boss
Manicured nails to set the pedicure off
She's fly effortlessly
She move like a boss do what a boss
Do she got me thinking about getting involved
That's the kind of girl I need
skrrt skrrt
Uh, uh, uh, yo

Yo, hold up keep it steady

And I ain't pushing a Chevy
I ain't even lyin', I ain't even sign
People want my back
Yo, what's up with that?
See, running out the mouth gon' get your face slapped
Tell me do you like what you see
Is it tight as could be?
No, Mase ain't writing for me
And I have no desire to be
Or have fake chicks rhyme wit me
Uhh, you ain't my man, you ain't down wit me
You ain't certified Harlem World get from 'round me
And Mase my big brother thats why you surround me
You could drop me off the same place you found me
Cuz it won't be long before you have to crown me
If I'm chicken, I'm jerk chicken and we're flickin'
And men die with chicks, so am I worth kissin?

The new kids around, cause this is our town
Our town, our town
Welcome to bottom of the map
Where we young and we hungry, us kids don't play
And I rep for the city that I come from
ATL I was born and raised
And I talk that talk
Cause I walk that walk
I was taught to work hard get paid
Spit wild freestyles on the playground
While making mad girls look my way
So hey, whatcha know bout young man
With a plan to make a new way
Through breaking every obstacle thrown in his way
Still breaking records and doing it at a new pace
Can't touch what you can't see but us the new kids, we be
That freshman class but it's kinda backwards
Cause I'm teaching half of these head masters new things
Never EXTRA credit, if I want it then I get on the mic and get it
Better read that inspirational sign
In the back that says “skies the limit”
School is now in session
For your first lesson, “talk is cheap”
Better put that pen to the pad
And scribble out your thoughts till your fingers bleed

Y'all gotta beg my pardon on it
But this shit sound like God don't it?
Yuugh, I'm tired, nigga and y'all gotta pay your tithes, nigga
Call my Phantom the holy ghost, church on chrome wheel tires, nigga
Pop tags when I'm paranoid, cause the pawn shop was my paradise
I was dead pop when that powder came for that knot saved in that shoebox
Blue tops, blue tops, bad bitch in that blue fox
This big face is in blu-ray and these black diamonds like Boondocks
I restore the feelin' of when niggas made a killin'
Hidin' choppas in the closet, half a million in the ceiling
And them hoes with angel faces, cryin' loud with ill intentions
Just so I can buy them Christians, have 'em shittin' on all they bitches, ah!

Horrible outcome, a dope boy got one motive
Cries when he convicted, cried on every visit
I'm cryin' sayin' his name, ride for all my niggas
Used to fiddle my finger 'til I found me a fortune

Old top 5 sitting on the bleachers
Popping pieces not two fingers
So high you touch me get fouled for reaching
You ain't flipping keys boy you ain't Alicia
Claim to spit ether you don't do that either
Boy you softer than a slice of pizza
But watch how I top it
I'm the fucking trending topic when you niggas done talking
About the niggas at the top *bitch*
And your heart keeps stopping
Pants keep dropping 'cause the cash keep coming
""Hard to understand me cause my jaw keep locking""
I ain't saying that I'm here for the dollar
I rape teams, cause I am a baller
I smoke dope, with MC Arsene
Look, Spurs, I walk right past them
Mesut Özil and I'm here for days
I just signed for the Arsenal and it's already pay day
I know what they needed, what they needed was a saviour
No worries to the Gooners, cause I'm here to save ya
PSG, United, they had no chance
You know Mesut, he only needed one glance
At Arsenal impartially I decided
Here I will go, no I'm not misguided
Uh, uh, uh
skrrt skrrt
Put your hands in the air
I'm sending a message in a bottle
It says ""We need a new tomorrow""

Yeah we need some new leaders to follow
I'm telling you everything that I know
{?} got {?} cause he got my vote
And I'mma tell you this because I should
Sting, you the only police good in the hood
Air, air, now throw your hands in the air, air
And we gonna elect John the mayor
Just a castaway
An island lost at sea
Another lonely day
With no one here but me
More loneliness
Than any man could bear
Rescue me before I fall into despair

So that explain why I love college
Gettin' brain in the library 'cause I love knowledge
When you use your Medulla Oblongata

& do it while I sleep yeah a little osmosis
& that's my commandment you ain't gotta ask Moses

skrrt skrrt
I just wanna know
Do I have to tell a nigga how to touch me?
Do I have to tell a nigga how to hold me?
Do I have to tell a nigga when to call me?
Do I have to tell a nigga I'm lonely?
Do I have to feel wrong
When it ain't strong?
Keep my mouth closed?
(huh huh huh)
Can't a girl from tha hood find a homie
That ain't just tryna hang around me?
Do I have to show a nigga I'm a woman?
Do I have to apologize for my emotions?
Do I have to tell a nigga what to say to me
Every time he wanna get next to me?
Do I have to set a full cat black case?
Stroke cause he go
(mh girl no)
You've got a search magnetic power
That just keeps holding me down
Ooh ooh ooh
God did his thang must have snapped his fingers twice
Definition of a life, reason why I'm like
That's why I never hesitate to call you my wife
Support you found in Christ
Just ain't find a church I like
I know in order to see right, I need light
I am the magic man
Got the world in his hands, world in his hands
He said I am the magic man, world in his hands, world in his hands
Is anybody out there?
skrrt skrrt
The show goes on in 6 minutes and this is his lovely assistant
She's so beautiful don't you agree?
He made her to the star she always wanted to be
Buhblaaoowww, are those the stars you wanted to see?
The magic man could make the roof disappear in every car in his fleet
Was on dubs, he could take a bird flip it to 3
Release the doves, turn any bar into the fight club
Gotta fight every night to prove my love
You messing with this joker but you need a king
Cause he'll club anybody trying to jack his queen
I'mma call a spade a spade from the start
He gave you diamonds, should've gave you his heart, you see?
Jealousy strikes again, but she, said I'm just trying to wave at the man
Then he, turned her eyes black and blue with the wave of his hand
The Magic Man
skrrt skrrt
Abracadabra, from a dime piece to pieces of a dime bag lady
Each package, new baggage
Implemented a tragic plan
A volunteer from the audience, for the magic man
Wait a second, would you rather me not talk at all? 'Cause I don't want to like, I don't want to rattle no cages or nothing, I don't want to like, I don't want to get in trouble. I want to be scared. I'm trying my best to be scared. I'm trying my hardest to be scared. No, no, no, I don't want to talk. I don't want to talk at all. As a matter of fact I'm just going to tip-toe on this
I'm scared of anonymous comments online. I'm scared of them. These words affect me so much. They affect me so much. No, I'm sorry. I'm scared, I'm scared. I'm scared of these corporations, like, not giving me another deal that they didn't give me already. I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm so shook. I'm so, so scared. So scared. Soooo
You ain't never seen, you ain't ever seen, that my great, great, great, granddaddy somehow ended up on that boat. Somehow he ended up on that boat. But I know that we were royalty. I know we built the pyramids. I know anything is possible. I know anything is possible. And everybody has a moment in time and I picked y'all when I was walking in Madison Square Garden, I just wanted to make sure, thank y'all for giving me this moment in time. 'Cause everybody has a moment. And in your moment you gotta own it. There's so many people have a moment and they don't own it 
You know, it's so funny when people compliment me and they say the word genius, and somehow that like, separates me from rappers in some way, there's the connotation of that. But what I need y'all to realize is Jay Z is a genius. And I need y'all to understand that Drake is a genius. I need y'all to understand that rap is an amazing way to express genius 
'Cause just as an architect would build buildings, we put our words together to express the shit that we going through. We are the modern day poets, obviously. But why are so many writers so condescending to the rappers? Why do they try to classify us as musicians as being ignorant in some way? Why do they try to classify us, as far as the classes go? You know how it goes, right? I think it's like a battle between art and architecture as the top. And if you're an artist or an architect, you look down upon a fashion designer. And if you're a fashion designer, you look down upon a musician. And if you a musician, you sign a deal with a corporation so you can buy a bigger house. And every time you go in the studio you watch your fucking mouth 
You watch, you watch your fucking mouth. You don't, you don't want to lose this house. But when they write these history books, they're not going to talk about what house we had. When they write the history books they aren't going to talk about the money we made. They're going to talk about the impact we had. They're going to talk about the impact we had 
And being that I saw The Hunger Games today, I wanted to bring up something, because it was very inspiring. It felt like almost a mimic of my exact life and shit. I know it. I was like, “Baby we gotta be on that movie board when they writing this shit.” And I saw Lenny Kravitz. There wouldn't be no song called “Niggas in Paris” if it wasn't for Lenny Kravitz. 'Cause that was the first nigga in Paris. Fucking with the models and shit, rocking Rick Owens head-to-toe and shit. Black. Rock. Star 
But what's interesting to me is like I was fond of hanging out with different people, in Paris, right. 'Cause Lenny Kravitz has like, the best taste. And he has like the dopest crib in Paris, everybody knows about it. And I don't know if you know this, but he designs furniture, he designs lighting fixtures, and he had been working on a clothing line for a long, long, long, long, long, long, long time. Long time. Long, long, long, long time 
And the designers would love it when Lenny Kravitz would show up at their fashion show. Yeah we gonna take some pictures of Lenny Kravitz and we gonna say he's at the such and such show, and that's gonna promote our brand. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Best you can. Hey Kanye, promote it the best you can. Hey Kanye, promote us the best you can. From Paris to New York all the way to Japan. Hey Kanye, I mean Lenny, I mean any of you niggas, promote it the best you can. Any of you niggas promote if the best you can 
So I said, “Wait a second, though.” I said, “I've got a dream of doing my clothing and I, I want to learn about furniture,” and you know what they told me when I was in Paris? You know when the W Magazine writer came out and wrote that classist-ass interview about me? You know what they said? You know what the billionaires told me? I went to about three or four different people and you know what they told me when I told them about my dreams? They said, “Lenny Kravitz wanted the same, same thing.” They said, “Lenny Kravitz wanted the same, same thing.” Don't let me sing because I want y'all to understand that I need to talk to you. They told me, “Hey that's cute, that's the same thing Lenny wanted to do.” Like it's a motherfucking joke. It wouldn't be no Kanye west if it wasn't for Lenny Kravitz. You know what I'm saying? 
But the only difference between me and Lenny Kravitz is I turned up on these niggas. I don't give a fuck about looking cool or being cool. And this is no disrespect to Lenny. But they got this shit called cool, everybody want to look cool, everybody want to be cool, everybody don't want to break their motherfucking cool, don't nobody want to look like a fool 
My boy [?], who used to work for Donda and now designs stages for Jay Z and Justin. The other day he said a word that I hadn't heard people say before. And he said he was working at some corporation, and the head of the corporation is always like, kind of down on him and shit, and the word was to marginalize. To marginalize. And then he also said he tried to make him look like an idiot in front of people, right? So has anyone here tonight ever read a piece of press or saw something or heard something on the radio where they tried to make me look like an idiot? Wait a second, I don't know, have you ever heard anything in the press where they're trying to make me look stupid? You know what I'm saying, like I'm actually stupid. (Laughs) You know what I'm saying, like I'm not smart, like stupid. Like, like what the fuck is wrong with him? You know what I'm saying? Have y'all ever read or heard someone say, “I don't like Kanye West”?

Even I fell victim to it, your pride don't let you do it
The lies will get you through it
Money, pussy, alcohol, what a wonderful cocktail
Fronted my first brick over oxtails and ran with it
Dope is like a two-way street
The addiction, both you and me, now take a seat
Every car got a fleet, every broad get a jeep
Every sparkle in the club that wasn't ours, we compete
Poor minds, poor decision makers
No reward, then what's the risk you taking?
New bitch I been fucking might start a rap war

Grey Goose will get you loose then hit the nigga producin'

Buyin' boots just to tell 'em that I Jimmy choose 'em
And take 'em back to confuse 'em

I wet cha all with the Holy water 
Spray from the Heckler, Koch auto 
You want me to give you a testimony about my life,
and how good he's been to me. I don't know what to tell you about him,
I love him so much with all my heart
and my soul with every bone in my body
I love him so much because he's done so much for me.
Every morning, every day of my life. I won't always be crying tears
in the middle of the night, and I won't always have to wake up by
myself wondering how I'm gonna get through the day.
I won't always have to think about what I'm gonna do and how I'm gonna,
how I'm gonna make it, how I'm gonna get there, because he...
Snippet
Won't let 'em take your love away
It's been a long way, but I made it here with love
I made it here with love, love
Said I've been and up and down and I've been through it all
Took a while to know my heart
Oh, yes, it did, yeah
Before love like this, you go
Through the fire and valley lows
But if you just hold on
Please hold on 'cause love is strong, it'll save yah
Oh, please hold on, it'll save yah, save yah
Truth can be the sweetest pain
It can mess up everything
It's the only way you know
I'm payin' for it, I'm changin' for it
Oh, oh, and it hurts
But I'll make it work
'Cause I'm no beginner
I'm a winner, paid dues, I know my purpose
[Refrain: Mary J. Blige]
Thought they'd put my life on hold
But I knew somethin' they didn't know
I know myself too much to ever fold
Dark clouds are movin' past you
Oh, you gotta love yourself
If you really wanna be with someone else
You gotta feed yourself
Before you feed somebody else
You gotta stay open, and don't be foolish
'Cause everybody don't mean you well
You gotta love yourself
Before you love somebody else
skrrt skrrt
Yeah, gotta love yourself
Uh, you know what I'm sayin'?
I decided not to use my color as a handicap
He a designer, artist, producer, and he rap
Never found virtue from patience
In a dark room just pacin'
Precious time is just wastin'
You do not know what we facin'
I cannot be complacent
skrrt skrrt
You don't see me in the hood
It's 'cause I'm doing this man
skrrt skrrt
Niggas I'm still grindin' (yeah...)
I'm still hearin' those sirens
I'm still getting chased by those lights
Only the lights lime and my mic's on
And my time is none because I'm writing more
And I ain't here to meet a soul in this buisness
I'm here to eat, speak until these hoes feel this (for sure...)
And I can't let y'all derail me man
I got young Kobe hommie, you gotta let go of Obie
'Cause Obie be back, (ain't goin' nowhere man...)
We got them craps going on and that yak going on
Soon as a nigga touch down back from tourin'
It's whatever, put that on the chedda man
But in the meantime it's Jimmy Ivean time
Chase cheese, rhyme till my voice give out
This is i,t my nigga's, this is what we boast about
Now I'm here, so shut your muthafuckin' mouth
And show me love bitch
skrrt skrrt
(I don't love you bitch)
I wanna hold you in the morning (ha)
Hold you through the night (hahaha)
skrrt skrrt
(We wanna love alcohol, we wanna love guns, we wanna love money)
I wanna hold you in the morning
Hold you through the night...(Ha) (we don't wanna love bitches though)
[Eminem]
There's a certain mystique when I speak
That you notice that's sorta unique
'cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep
And I'm stillmatic, the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, its like trying to smoke crack and go to sleep
I'm strapped
Just knowin' any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad, lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry
It ain't even money, you can't pay me enough
For you to play me, its cock-a-many
You just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My friends say I'm a fool to think that you're the one for me
I guess I'm just a sucker for love
Cause honestly the truth is that you know I'm never leaving
Cause you're my angel sent from above
skrrt skrrt
Baby you can do no wrong, my money is yours
Give you little more because I love you, love you
With me, girl, is where you belong, just stay right here
I promise my dear I'll put nothing above you, above you

skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
People try to tell me but I still refuse to listen
Cause they don't get to spend time with you
A minute with you is worth more than
A thousand days without your love, oh your love
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I'm in love with you
skrrt skrrt
And that haunted me
All the way home
So u never know
Never never know
skrrt skrrt
Till it's over love
Till we lose control
System overload
Screamin no no no no noooo
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
See I wanna move
But can't escape from you
So I keep it low
Keep a secret code

So I keep it true
I got something to lose
So I gotta move
I can't keep myself & still keep you too
skrrt skrrt
When I'm on my own
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
How many times did I take for it finally got through
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
See I had to go
See I had to move
No more wastin time
You can't wait for life
We're just racin time
Where's the finish line

So you never know, never never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming, ""No, no, no, n-nooo!""
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
So keep your love lockdown - your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown - your love lockdown
You keep your love lockdown - your love lockdown
You keep your love lockdown - you lose
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep my-self, and still keep you too
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, we can't wait for life
We're just racing time, where's the finish line?
skrrt skrrt
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
Know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on the roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
skrrt skrrt
Where I'm bout to go, I don't need you
I've been down this road, too many times before
skrrt skrrt
So keep your love locked down, so keep your love lockdown
So keep your love locked down, so keep your love lockdown 
Is anybody in the house right now in love right now? 
In love right now, well keep your love lockdown 
If anybody in the house right now is in love right now 
Try your best to keep your love lockdown 
Keep your love lockdown 
Keep it on 
Is it better to have loved and lost, than to never have loved at all? 
This brings us to the end of my VH1 Storyteller 
Thank you for 
Being my shrink today and the stage as my couch 
Thank you for allowing me to get some things off my chest and out of my mind 
The ghosts out of my head so they will not haunt me at night 
skrrt skrrt
What I had to do, had to run from you 
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong 
And that haunted me, all the way home 
So ya never know, never, never know 
Never know enough, til it's over, love 
Til we lose control, system overload 
Screamin no, no, no, no, no 
skrrt skrrt
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you 
So I keep it low, keep a secret code 
So everybody else don't have to know 
So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down 
Keeping ya love locked down, ya love locked down 
Now keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down 
Now keep ya love locked down, you lose 
I'm not lovin you, the way I wanted to 
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true 
I got somethin' to lose, so I gotta move 
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too 
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own 
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone 
How many times did I tell you fo' it finally got through 
You lose, you lose

[Sample: Kanye West]
What's Gucci my nigga? What's Louis my killa?
I feel like I can't follow in nobody footstep
Getting GuWop
(You know I pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop, at your head my nigga)
Young nigga, young nigga, pop pills, make mills, young nigga
Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga, young nigga
I think I'm ‘bout to lose it man
skrrt skrrt
In the trap still countin' change
Don't fuck with y'all ‘cause you niggas lame
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
On the choppa rant, on the choppa rant
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop
Still-a in that trap getting GuWop
Out the sewer, now my crib the size of Cuba
I be riding around with that blocka
We them Brick Squad, ask Flocka
Versace shit, Silk The Shocker
Coulda been San Quentin on lock
But I two'd up that ghost
I stack two floors that loaf
I be floor seats by that coach, I be fight seats by that rope
Lately so sick I could vomit, Gin with no tonic
Cheat on my bitch, you know I'm dishonest
But I'm just a product of my environment
Young nigga, young nigga
Pop pills, make mills young nigga
Got wrist, stay trill young nigga
Still talking that, still young nigga
And I ain't ever lose the chain
And shawty head stupid man
The power of observation
Marvels and frights and strange delights
Attributes, properties, disciplines and novelties
Ecstatic patterns in the calendar design
Wilderness tours, guided by and for the blind
Cool ruler standing still sweating through the shades
He knew those lights only grew bright to fade
Dead wrong pageantry, lottery and games
Sleight of hand provided by extravagant and fake
The carnival tilt bell the hustle for the age
They clutch what they covet, what must they give away?
Who was uninvited who was asked to come and stay?
Surprise, it's your life, it's your business anyway
So please pardon these and such curious minds
Peace, safe passage, precious time hither and gone
The day of days, Yawm al-Qiyāmah
This tiny stone illuminated by a star
The only star so large many more
To make our largest star show small
Furthermore, the end is not the end no stop but a pause
And what we can witness isn't all there is at all
Custom mock of a scotch and pork chops
The passion, expansion, the order of the random
See the dreamers, see the sleepers
Why'd you wake them?
Sweet Jesus and life on Earth
Seek heaven first
Let's put in this work
Her heels set the mood
Where did you acquire those Alaia's
When I met you I heard Jesus, bells, strings, and the choir
I got lines that's better than niggas' albums, plural
The king of the urban make your shit sound rural
She said I hit it so deep she need a epidural
Them other niggas have you looking like a squirrel
Now that nuts. I only hang with white boys that like black sluts
Tell them Plain Pat yo that track sucks
We ain't dissing you
But you in the position to play something for us to listen to
I'm trying to worry about my scratch minus the crabs
I ain't stopping for you niggas like yellow cabs
I got scripts so why we need a movie?
And if I'm a douche then put me in your coochie
I swear they should have never gave these niggas loose leaf
Re-Up Gang Pusha
(Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble)
But you found it, mutherfucker
All I see is black roses, drug dealer poses
Shoveling that devil's angel up they noses
Never let jail turn my Shyne into Moses
Couldn't cleanse my soul with them Civil Rights hoses
Panoramic roof, under glass like a coaster
Backseat driver, racial slurs at the chauffeur
Killian loafers, Mikimoto chokes her
Photo-op is priceless, frame our wanted posters
The Audacity, war brings casualty
Bitch have my son before I face that tragedy
I order hits, she orders mahi
R.I.P. Vivian Blake, shout out the Shower Posse
Gone
skrrt skrrt
(You seek out problems)
(Looking for trouble)
But you found it, motherfucker 
I miss the misogyny, bad bitches massagin' me 
Sometimes we lowered our standards at the colleges 
So please don't judge me, uh, for the followin': 
Fat bitches swallowin', skinny bitches modelin' 
Take off that Givenchy and let's get raunchy 
I have your face looking all Captain Crunchy 
The devil stay testing, 'cause when you chase the pussy it's a sin 
But if it falls in your lap, it's a blessin' 
Soon as I got salad, I spent it all on dressin' 
French, to be exact, that Balmain was impressive 
Hedi Slimane leathers 
(Cyhi! Yeah!) 
Boy, we lookin' for trouble 
Maybe if we wasn't black, then we wouldn't have struggled 
Player, all I got is trap niggas and crooks in my huddle 
They cook and I smuggle, got twenty pounds of kush in the duffle 
So I'm runnin' through them circles, boy, I'm looking like Knuckles 
Look at my knuckles, got the hook in 'cause niggas was looking 
I've tooken some whoopings, so trust me, dog, I'm good for a scuffle
Don't be mad I whooped your ass, 'cause I've tooken a couple 
Feds askin' niggas questions, but I wouldn't rebuttal 
‘cause I'm Jake Gyllenhaal, I'm in the hood with the bubble 
With a tall model broad like I took her from Russell 
Didn't play the cards I was dealt, I made the dealer re-shuffle 
Royal Flush, so kiss my royal nuts 
Ain't nothin' silver spooned, I came from the soil, bruh 
But now I'm eatin' off of Raffaello Gold 
Exquisite ravioli with some happy yellow hoes 
But don't get it confused when I rap these mellow flows 
Yeah I see the gun but it's a pellet
Yeah the ball is in your court, but it's appellate
They sayin Acid was an album retail it
I said I got way too much soul for me to sell it
That's why godfather tied the cape on my shoulders
Said save em from false prophets and wolves in sheeps' clothing
I'm a little too hard to be slept on
I'm a little too sharp to be stepped on
A little too Pac for the septum
I'm so pretty I make mirrors blush
I spit the shit in a party to make your ear adjust
I'm a parapalegic parrot with a pair of crutches in a no fly zone
On the phone talking bout how Bush trying to disparage us
How y'all feeling tonight?
Thank y'all for coming out to this impromptu-type performance I just set up
I love the energy in this city
This is one of my hometowns, y'all know I stayed out here, right?
But I came here for the creativity more than anything,
Because creativity fuels everything
I hate business people
People get on the phone with me and talk to me
Like ""What kind of business can he do though?
What type of businnes are you doing? What's the numbers?
How much did you sell? What's the radio spins?
How much shampoo can you sell with your face on it and shit?""
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Make it even more mellow, make it just the chords
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I know it's for more than just to get rich.
skrrt skrrt
Since when was making art about getting rich?
I know it's easy for me to say
Because having money's not everything and not having it is
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Remind me again why the Grammy's could suck my dick?
Remind me who's the original superfly
And I got love for Hov but I ain't fucking with that Suit and Tie
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Every nigga tryna get rich,
Every rapper tryna get rich,
And every rapper always rap about fucking somebody else bitch
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
And why the Grammys can suck my dick
Suck my dick
And every motherfucking sponsor
They tryna put they logos all over the concerts and shit
For a meet and greet
And you gotta meet the execs and they daughters
And they'll show what they just bought her
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
They say ""Ayo, you coming on too strong in this bitch""
They always talking about what I'm doing wrong in this shit
Well I can give a fuck everything
I can give a fucking anything
Remind me why we in this shit
I lost my motherfucking momma
So I can give a fuck about your comments
I promise, I promise
Cause we all gonna die one day
But I'mma live my life my way!
Remind me why we in this shit, please
Please, can I sell your drink for you, please
""So, you can help me put on a better show please, corporations?
Can you please support me? Please?
Me, Kanye West. I swear I'm a nice nigga now
I swear I'll put the pink polo back on,
I swear to you. Please. Just for 3 million
I need it so bad. I need a pool in my backyard!
So I'll tell all my fans your shit is cool
And if they believe in me, then they should also believe in you
""‘Did we get the check yet? Hold on, I gotta call the business manager
skrrt skrrt
I say he's so sweet, make her wanna lick the wrapper
Lollipop, lollipop
Breasts is just like Dolly Parton
She ride my spaceship 'til she hit the top
That hit the spot, 'til she ask
""How many li-i-li-i-licks do it take 'til she get to shop?""
Don't worry why my wrists got so freeze?
Tell her, ""Girl, like Doritos, that's nacho cheese""
Tell her friends, ""Like Fritos, I'm trying to lay""
I can't only have one and I ain't tryin to wait""
This a song with Wayne, so you know it's gonna melt
But you ain't finna murder me like everybody else
I'mma rap like I got some type of respect for myself
I don't do it for my health, man I do it for the belt
Man, I do it to the death, 'til the roof get melt
Hundred degrees, drop the roof, so the coupe don't melt
Man, the flow so cold chicken soup won't help
We need fo' mo' hoes, we need oh-oh-oh-oh!
You know what it is when we're outta town
We ball in 2 seats, and you out of bounds

Livin' fast, now it's all linen rags
Hard-headed, but my top peelin' back
Tinted glass on my '57, nigga wit' a attitude (Me)
Young and radical, methods are mathematical
Let my convertible marinate on the avenue
Mami, that's half a million, I'm livin' la vida rapido
Die young, but fuck it, we flew first class
Turned you to a rich bitch by your first glass
Up in this bitch and we lit up like a screen
Every time we hit the charts, niggas shoot up like a fiend
Stuntin' like we printin' money< with machines
What you see me wavin', Vacheron Constantine
Like Mike, my Spikes stay all white
Twenty-four karat gold, eighty carats worth of ice
Ice insured, fuck life insurance
I live for the moment, and put a bullet on that (Bawse)
Got the club rockin' like a fuckin' boat
I'm the pirate on this ship, all you mates got to go
Good party over here, everybody over here
You know the word travel fast, everybody know we here
All the bottles over here, even spread it over there
All the models over here, but they swallow everywhere
She came to party like it's 1999
If she died on my dick, she would live through my rhymes

For all my young ladies ladies that drivin' Miss Daisy
Drivin' me crazy, rock the beat, baby
Hop up out the ERR! she eat up the pavement
I don't give a ERR!, baby, he crazy
I'm back by unpopular demand
Least he still poppin' in Japan, shoppin' in Milan
Hoppin' out the van, screams from the fans
""Yeezy, always knew you'd be on top again!""
And we 'bout to hit Jacob the Jeweler
So I can be like Slick Rick, and rule ya
Dr. Martin Louis the King, Junior
skrrt skrrt
From the realm of the dunzillas
From Chi town to uptown
My man Rashaun, Kanye, Seldom C, Sway
Meet Grav
And spark on this like 4th day 'Raq
Flow's wicked like eurocentrics, magically makin' men emerge
Spiritual urge, that leave from their body to surge to witness my verbs
Leave holes in chest cavities like vaginas black
Finger poppin' souls with facts
Mishaps and missteps, repulsive acts nonstop
We load the clip to keep my mind skills on cock
Against corrupted MCs, splittin' their skulls with one swift motion
Cosmic destruction cause I get high from Merlin's potion
Yo mad niggas got dreams of the Lexus and coupes
Got their signin' bonus and bought TECs for the video shoot
Ayo them shits backfired before the cameraman arrived, he died
For his image, now let's start the scrimmage
In the first quarter, I sacked 25 MCs
By halftime you still got rhymes but they are diseased
They infected with 75 seconds of life left
I cremate MCs and breathe they ashes in my life's breath
In a life or death situation
I come through with the Chi representation
And bleed you pussies every month like ovulation
The sensation'll shine through your mind
Take it line for line
Play across the board to rob these niggas blind
When we're takin' 'em line for line
Yo let's react with our mind, kill the black-on-black crime
I'll be takin' it line for line
Yo what you got, nigga?
I got a fix for your binge
Laced dope that soaks nerves numb
Slung in slums to a steady stream of clientele
Eager tongues fold under pressure, the parallel
Doubt disarrays the strongest efforts like a spell
The spell will lift, the truth be even more vague
Infectious on phonograph, a verbal plaque plague
That preys on focused ears, I steer the culture in a new direction
Disarm your psyche before you can reach your Smith & Wesson
I write like a cartel
Melody mercenaries that fits the art well
A secret order of chosen artists summoned from global markets
Plottin' precise assaults on sub-terrainian targets
Citizens seek refuge from bombshed that drops constant
Poetically potent content executed on some calm shit
Yo I heard they said [?] ghettobred, thorough head
That an MC that can't rhyme is better off than said
Hey Jimmy, where you going?
I don't know where I'm goin'
My Dad died, and he left me his degrees
My mom would always say ""Dad, why don't you work?""
But he just kept learning
All the other kids' parents were working and saving up money for school
And I was actually in school all while my dad was in school!
He was so greedy with degrees, he took my degree
Yeah a-yo Fab

A.K.A. Marty McFly
And I'm on my fly shit
Straight from the Chi bitch
skrrt skrrt
I can tell they ain't they used to this
You keep askin' questions
Dumb ass suggestions
Must ain't never lived like this
Why the funny faces
Nah the funny taste
You just ain't never drink like this
You can't even lie
You probably got high
But you ain't never smoked like this
I see shoppin' bags
Might pop some tags
But you was never fly like this
I'm a let your wife peep game
Get used to this shit
Introduce her to shit
Like Life meet Lane
Lane meet Life
Y'all two get acquainted
Its so cool bein' my new chick ain't it?
Let me explain it
I don't make up shit
I just Lorraine it maybe Jacob shit
Make a 36D from a A cup bitch
Sleep with me you might wake up with (With what?)
A set of keys to a pad and a Jag
Fendi sprees Paddington bags
Cockiness to add in your swag
Take a look at what you had and then gag
Like eww
Anybody know a girl that don't like heels? (Do you?)
That's like askin' is the nose on Mike real (Is it?)
Hell naw
Well ma
I'm here to catch you
They say men are dogs you know what I'm here to fetch you
skrrt skrrt
I walk through the halls of the school and it's cool to be known by many for my rapping ability
But what about the brothers who ain't got it like me
Making money off the trade
You could say I had it made
Drugs are on the rise
(All engines running)
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt

skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
'Bout to take this whole thing to Mars
(Lift off) Lift off, takin' my coat off
Showin' my tattoos, I'm such a showoff (Huh?)
I feel the pain and then rolled off
I got the whole city they about to go off
How many niggas with' me up in this bia'?
How many people wanna roll with me ah'?
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt

skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
You know, know me by now
skrrt skrrt
Top 5 emcees you gotta rewind me
skrrt skrrt
This what ya'll been waitin' for ain't it
Chilling with my team counting this fucking money
I stay with presidents like special agents honey
You get it from the bank
I get it from the mint
Only new bills call me the fresh prince
We gon' take over the whole world
Real all the time, Rattpack so thorough
Used to rock sterling
And now my shorty wearin' pearls
Fuck with grown women no time for these lil' girls
I used to think about the things in which I never had
But now whenever I reflect it only makes me glad
I went from H.O.C. to chauffeurs in the HOV
But hustlin' tapes like they was keys
So much paparazzi catch an epileptic seiz'
I used to struggle with this shit now I kill it with ease
Started nation wide now I'm tourin over seas
Life of a don money blowing in the breeze
Just gots me a crib and a new car too
I got the ring, but I gotta have you babe
skrrt skrrt
C'mon let's get married
Let's have some kids with a dog with a house
A lil white fence, just like this, babe
skrrt skrrt
Let's get married
skrrt skrrt
Meet me at the alter
In your white dress (your white dress)
You won't ever need another man
You never, ever want from another thing, no
I've been feeling you
I must confess (must confess)
Ain't no gonna break this thang up
I ain't going nowhere, no
Cuz when I think about you and think about me
Plain to see that we might as well do it (do it)
skrrt skrrt
Said you want some karats
Babe, how bout ten (how bout ten)
Is it good enough for you to brag on
When you show your friends (show your friends)
I just want to be with you
Yeah, check check, testing
It's clear out there, yeah
It's like I'm hang glidin' over the hood, ha
Never worry (ohhh, no, no, no)
Check, let there be light
No gang bangin' in New York tonight
Just murals of Biggie Smalls, bigger than life
Turn up the kid mic ‘cause ya'll ain't listenin' right
What's all this talk that Nas got bought?
I'd rather outline my body in white chalk
Ain't nobody been where I been, they at a stand still
This is all overseen by my man Will
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I know that I ain't got much time left
And they don't really wanna see the good in me
Ain't satisfied until they see the fool in me
And I know my business, so my sins great
And I thank the hood for all the love they gave
And I forgive 'em all, they did they best to hate
Oh, let there be light!
This ain't to glorify, just painting a street picture
There's no guidance or Bibles, just blunts and swishers
Gillettes cut 'caine in kitchen
Now every rapper wanna claim he hang with Kenneth ""Supreme"" McGriff, and
It's like the same difference except when niggas get arraigned
They don't want the same sentence, niggas get to snitchin
If I could reverse demises and turn falls to rises
And bring back the niggas who was livest
Old hustlers, reminiscing on better days
They home, doing nothing, might as well be in a cage
Hating on young brothers, one foot in the grave
They used to love us
Till we found our own way through the maze
[Produced by Deezle & Kanye West]
Yeah, I see you big bro
I'mma kill these niggas man, yeah
Straight off the block with it
Eagle Street to be specific
I'm peeping at you people different
I pay my dues, you keep the difference
I can see the end in the beginning
So I'm not racing, I'm just sprinting
Cause I don't wanna finish
They diminish
I replenish
Scientific
I'm out this world ho
I wear bright red, like a girl toe
skrrt skrrt
Fingernails dirty
I've been counting dirty money since 12:30
A.M
Weigh them
If they short, take them
Right back and spray him
skrrt skrrt
Yeah, I just do my Wayne
And every time I do it, I do my thing
Yeah believe that, like a true story
Rims big, make the car look like it's two stories
If I hop out, that'd be suicide
No back seats, call that paralyze
I don't have a spine
I don't fantasize
I mastermind
Then go after mine
You see I handle mine
I dismantle mine
I tote a tool box; bitch, it's hammer time
So excuse me as I nail 'em to something
I'm just repel 'em
skrrt skrrt
Someone tell 'em
skrrt skrrt
I'm gon' fill 'em up
His momma can't tell 'em
And doctors can't heal 'em
skrrt skrrt
And yea we sell 'em
I know you smell 'em
And if you want it, you could just yell it
And it be in the morning, at your 'telly
Whole ki go for twenty
Half a ki go for eleven
After me there will be nothing
I am legend
And I Will Smith
Now that's how ya let the beat build bitch!
That's how you let the beat build, bitch
Now that's how you let the beat build, bitch
Let the beat build, bitch
And the beat goes
Boom Bi-Bom Bi-Bom
Boom Bi-Boom Bi-Boom, it goes
Bom Bi-Bom Bi-Bom, now say
Huh, c'mon, just a snare and a 808
Weezy Baby on the mic, D.O.A
Ok, I'd like to thank Kanye
Want to be your man, please...tell you why
(I know what y'all thinking)
Doop doop doop doop doop doop
(First he can't be my man, now he want to be my man)
(I wish this nigga make his mind up)
Can't live my life...tell you why
(All my niggas man we gonna have be 21 bout this shit you know)
Oh baby, oh baby
(We gonna step out the track for one sec, one sec)
Now what I got to say, seal with a kiss
Know I can't be your man why I feel like this
What I need with a woman when I live like this
Different chicks running in and out the crib like this
Maybe five, maybe six, seven, eight'll be enough
Plus the twins make ten but for you I give it up
Set times to the side just for us to live it up
Walking out of Ralph Lauren, purple label linen, yuh
It's hard for me to discuss what I had vision for us
Lots of trust, and a crib worth a couple million plus
So what if I got a pass, labelled a dirt bag
By the minute, hearts I broken and women I hurt bad
Might I add Christian Dior and fur jackets
A part of the package, but still far from a marriage
It's easy to lose balance when hearts just start carin
With the attractions apparent, its hard to stop starin

I'll be late for that, i can't wait for that

So I'm comin in when i feel like
So turn this muthafucka up only if it feels right

Stop all ya blood clot cryin, I was flyin
Made it to school with barely enough time to sign in
Yeah i hear the alarm, Yeah i hear ya mom
Yeah yeah i dont wanna be broke when im 31
They say the best classes go to the fastest
Sorry Mr.West there's no good classes
and thats what yo ass get
Not even electives, not even perequese
You mean i miss my major by a couple of seconds
Now im in the shop class or the basket weavin
Where all the rest of them muthafuckas under acheivin
Man this is an insult, I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow
If i could catch the beat and slow down the tempo
Jus throw this at the end if im to late for the intro
Well i'll make it from a student loans to a Benzo
Like old folks pissin i guess it all depends
Ohhh Ohhh
Last night I was walking through the harbor,
Where the fishing boats are lying on the shore,
The news had traveled fast and everyone went to be,
Where the mayor was making a speech,
And the crowd started cheering,
When he talked about the glory of it all,
And the boys coming home from the war;
Last night, they were dancing in the streets,
And making music in the alleyways and bars,
From a house down in the old town came the sound of guitars,
Margarita was waiting inside,
With her long black hair hanging down beneath the red light,
And she smiled, for the boys coming home from the war,
The boys coming home from the war;
Yo fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost
For making me do this shit motherfucker
Had to throw everybody out the motherfucking room
Cause they don't fucking
(I'd like to propose a toast)
(I said toast motherfucker)

The all around the world Digital Underground, Pac
The Rudolph the red nosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain, my 15 seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
Rocafella's only niggas that help
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here
They say he bourgie, he big-headed
Won't you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious, give me 10 seconds
I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
It's funny how wasn't nobody interested

Un faisceau viseur laser transmet l'esprit de science-fiction et offre une multitude de sujets à discuter concernant le faisceau de lumière artificielle. Un adulte peut superviser un élève du primaire comme elle fait son propre pointeur laser de faible puissance. Le pointeur laser sera modifié à partir d'une lampe de poche existante, et la diode laser nécessaire sera acheté dans un magasin d'alimentation du laser. Quelques outils trouvés dans la maison seront également nécessaires.
Instructions
1 Dévissez le bouchon de la batterie à l'arrière de la lampe de poche laser puissant 50000mW. Retirez les piles et placez-les et le couvercle de côté.
2 Dévisser le réflecteur à l'avant de la lampe de poche. Poussez la lentille en plastique sur le réflecteur avec un de vos doigts. Jetez la lentille en plastique loin dans la poubelle.
3 Dévissez l'ampoule de la prise du module de la lampe dans la lampe de poche avec vos doigts. Sortez l'ampoule de la lampe de poche et en disposer correctement ou de le ranger.
4 Insérez des pinces à nez dans la lampe de poche. Saisir le bord du module de lampe avec des pinces. Retirez le module de la lampe sur la lampe de poche.
5 Placez une feuille de papier journal sur une table pour protéger la table. Placer le module de la lampe sur le journal avec la prise vers le haut.

Got Adidas from my feet up, check my sneaker
Get a 100 thousand for the feature

What is going on and it's Michelle LA's 97-01 radio is what you're listening to. First thing I walk in the door and right behind me here he is Kanye West
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
How are you?
skrrt skrrt
I'm awesome
skrrt skrrt
I know you're doing a ton of interviews right now, this is the first time you've been to Amp radio, so I have to say thank you
skrrt skrrt
Okay, awesome
skrrt skrrt
This is pretty major and, I don't know, you probably have no way of knowing this, but the very first song I ever played on amp radio, about four years ago, was ""Paranoid""
skrrt skrrt
Well thank you very much
skrrt skrrt
Absolutely we're huge fans around here
skrrt skrrt
Thank you, I appreciate that
skrrt skrrt
Thanks for coming in. So what's the story behind all of a sudden we're seeing you in front of us? Because you haven't done a whole lot of these kinds of interviews but now here you are, so we're thrilled to have you here. You just feel like going out and saying hello?
skrrt skrrt
Yeah, that's it
skrrt skrrt
That's awesome. I dig that. So you're out on the Yeezus tour right now which, first, your album is awesome. The live show sold out at Staples on Saturday night, you got another one and then you've got Anaheim on Friday, so tell me a little bit about what to expect at the tour stops, because like I just told you before we went on the air, I saw a little bit of the clips but I feel like it doesn't do it the justice of actually being there and experiencing the show in the moment
skrrt skrrt
Yeah even if I explain it...you know it's just like creativity central. It's an example of like what DONDA can do - that's my creative company - it's an example of what happens when you put amazing thinkers in a room together and eliminate what they normally do and all the cliches that people slip into and challenge everyone in that room to come up with something completely new, and that's what is, completely new. You know we we experiment with things, and they get better, and it's going to get better as it goes, but if I have an idea, I just do it. I just go for it
skrrt skrrt
Yeah that's cool, there's a certain fearlessness about you which I really dig. Do you feel like you get crap for that a little bit? The people misunderstand you?

Keep rocking and keep knocking

You see the hate that they serving on a platter
So what we gonna have, dessert or disaster
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like in I'm a race but I already won first place
skrrt skrrt
You got me thinking bout our life, our house, and kids
Every morning I look at you and smile
Cause boy you came around and you knocked me down, knocked me down
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I never thought I'd hear myself say
Y'all go ahead
I think I'm going to kick it with my girl today
I used to be commander-in-chief of my pimp ship flying high
Til I met this pretty little missile, shot me out the sky
Hey, so now I'm crashing
Don't know how it happened
skrrt skrrt
Said if I could go back and make it happen faster
skrrt skrrt
Miss Independent, the load never too much, she helping me pull it

Cole, Cole, Cole, Cole, Cole, hey
And on the count of three, Blow up, Blow up
Yeah, and that I will, nigga, that I will
I keep a checklist of rappers that I'mma kill
I used to play the bleachers before I had a deal
Now a nigga gettin burnt, just imagine how that feel
Hmm, ill, fantastic
Flip rhymes, flip beats, nigga, ""Jam""nastics
Your style hot now, but they just can't last with
Something like the rap sand-castle
Gone with the tide, I'm here for the seasons
Bend yo' ass over bitch I'm here for a reason
Cold breezin', flow freezin'
This ain't spittin' ho, I'm sneezin'
Used to hit South Beach, stay at the Parisian
No fun nigga, low funds was the reason
Old school bed that the hoes got pleased in
Now them Lowes doors, is what I throw keys in
Man, talk about a come up
Yo Monica, I know you shootin' that video in there
Aw, you just ain't gon' let me in the video, huh?
No no, i-it's me, Kanye West (It's funny how the tables turn)
You know, th-throw your diamonds up? Through the wire? (turn)
You ain't seen my video, heh? (turn, turn)
You know, I- like me and Missy we did this song
Together whatever
Um, okay, well
skrrt skrrt
I can't keep knockin' and keep rockin' and keep poppin'
I keep droppin' and keep poppin' and keep rockin'
But I can't keep knockin' and keep knockin'
And keep poppin' and keep rockin'
Let's get it poppin'
[Missy Elliot {*overlaps Kanye West Interlude*] 
So upset 
This that hot shit 
Uh huh, yeah 
New Monica! 
Now you ain't let me in the video (true) 
Play me like Semi did Arsenio (true) 
I'm Kanye from the Chi city yo (who?) 
I'm the nigga that did the beat yo 
You know we too old for this like Holyfield still boxin' 
Ya will watch and I look back, ya still watchin' 
What he got that I ain't got? I got Benz 
I got rims, not 20s but I got 10s 
Real real clean, come and get your rear wheel cleaned 
She did what with who? Man I hear things 
Like when I was doin' my dirt and she heard things 
Up worryin' while she wore her ring 
Now she got a fling and where's her ring? 
That [?VVS?] is in the purse now, feelin's in the dirt now 
Somebody buyin' the bar, quenchin' her thirst now 
Somebody bought her a dress, she in the church now 
And what's worse now, she ain' gotta work now 
She cuffed an NBA player from the first round 
I grabbed her neck and made it hurt to breathe 
She said ""Security, this jerk could leave"" 
And uh 
So do just what you want anytime that you really like 
I put a payment on my place, you'll be sleepin' alone tonight 
So don't you come knockin' 
Knock knock knock, stop knocking 
Don't come knocking at my do' 
(Don't you come knockin' at, whoa) 
Ring ring ring, let the phone stop 
I don't want you calling me no mo' 
skrrt skrrt
We fresh off-mutherfuckin South Beach
Yea, uh
Sometimes play the villain, sometimes play the hero
Sometimes I be Dilla, sometimes I be Preemo
Sometimes I be feeling, I got a big ego
Other times a nigga swim around like Nemo
Uh, small fish in a big ass pond
Pushed around like a mower on a big ass lawn
I get my weight up, inflate up
And make these old niggas open the gate up
At the mansions that they laid up in
Like, ""Hello my name is Cole"" - I'm walking right up in and well known
Don't give a fuck it you gon hate it man, hey fellow
Either you follow me or swallow me bitch
And I done hit to many hoes to ever pause that shit
Now since I just seen my face up in the XXL
A few chicks want to text ""let's chill""-how obvious
Girls from all over the world is my hobby
[Produced by Sebastian Sartor & Kanye West]
This is my time, this is my hour
This is my pain, this is my name, this is my power
If it's my reign, then it's my shower
This pole position, I made a lane cause they blocked ours
Dope boys, block bleeders
Gold diggers don't stop either
Motivation is misguided if you hit the mark, then it's not needed
Carry on like a carry on, on my side bitch I let tag along
Call me ""daddy"" from a complex
Cause her mother's fucker wouldn't marry mom
No excuses, no regard
Step on the brick like a promenade
Twenty thousand on calling cards
And I'm speaking spanish like Don Omar
But I'm King Push, this king push
I rap nigga 'bout trap niggas
I don't sing hooks
Fuck nigga, with the sly talk
Miss me, with all the pie talk
When them lights on you, and them letters there
You point us out, just like an eye-chart
Til the casket drops
Third time's a charm right? Come on
I'm kinda like a big deal, it's unbelievable
You see my warning gives you big chills
The flow running on Big's heels
My life after death, Big ain't get to see how this feels
Third time's a charm baby
After two classics another stripe up on my arm baby
It's a blessing to blow a hundred thou in a recession
With no second guessin'
Ha-ha, we're ballin', drop tops we're floorin'
Champagne we're pourin'
Re-Up is the gang and I'm all in
To the powder and the flame I have fallen
Get money, blow money is my calling
Yeah, watch a nigga burn through it
Life's a maze, you twist and you turn through it
The driest of droughts, maneuvered and I earned through it
I'm set straight like a perm do it, Push
They whispering about us, I know you haters doubt us
How you count our money
We ain't even finished counting
Pardon me, I must say, I'm kinda like a big deal
Ayo, I'm sitting on top of the.. it's More Than a Feeling, ain't it?
I be killing, damn it, I'm ill and I'm ill and ay-ay-ay
Meet Mr. Popular, go get your binoculars
And see Penthouse 3 where a nigga be

[Zane Lowe:]
Grab a seat, grab a seat. So, you remember this place? Graduation? (It's cool, yeah). I was also thinking about some of the other things we've done as well with the BBC, like Abbey Road sprung to mind with the strings
skrrt skrrt
Oh yeah. That was good. That suit was like, I would've worn something different if I could look back right now. I could still do a suit, I just wouldn't have done that exact lapel situation
skrrt skrrt
But talk about really putting yourself on the line with that. That was so early on for you to be stepping in a room with that many players and that kind of – to give yourself that objective. What are your thoughts when you think back about Abbey Road, where…it's just nuts 
skrrt skrrt
I thought it was good. I thought it was what I was supposed to do at that time. If I see something, if I see an opportunity, I'm gonna go for it. You know what I'm saying – We're all gonna die one day 
skrrt skrrt
Yeah, that's true 
skrrt skrrt
So live like that. Live like you could die tomorrow. Go for it. Those steps have been the, you know, the platforms that allowed me to make it this far 
skrrt skrrt
And you have, man, and you're here. Six original albums of your own, a Throne record, various records with G.O.O.D. Music to talk about, man. But seriously, man, Yeezus. Bravo, dude. I mean, that is one of the most creative records of any genre I've heard in a very, very long time, and you know, just in terms of your output, your most exciting-sounding record, I think 
skrrt skrrt
Oh, thank you very much. Yeah, I feel I was able to start making exactly what was in my mind again, not having to speak with the textures of the time. Cause, you know, Cruel Summer is definitely Kanye West, and there's something weird and kind of off about “Mercy,” like when it has the high-pitched, that type of sound. It sounds like art still a little bit, even thought it obviously was a radio smash 
But it's still – when I get into the idea, the trap drums and things like that, certain songs that are blatant radio hits, it's like I'm speaking with today's textures. And that's – if you look at it 200 years from now, it's not going to stand out in the way that 808's or Yeezus stands out, and can completely push or redefine or make people say, you know: hey, I completely hate that, or I completely love that, but let me just think differently. Because everybody is bound to these — no pun intended — they're bound to sixteen bars or eight bars, and you know the normal radio – the radio thing 
I was talking to Frank Ocean about this, and said, my mom got arrested for the sit-ins, and now we're more like the sit-outs. Like, sit off of radio, and say, hey radio, come to us. We need to find something new, because it's being controlled in a way, and manufactured in a way, that really awesome artists can make amazing music and not break as far past as, like, something that's very formulaic 
skrrt skrrt
So it almost feels like a duty to you in a weird way? Having the peoples' ear, having peoples' attention for great music, to be able to say, well, if I'm not challenging them enough, I'm not challenging myself, not challenging radio, what am I doing? 
skrrt skrrt
Yeah. I'm not trying to regurgitate myself. I showed – showed people that I understand how to make perfect. Dark Fantasy could be considered to be perfect. I know how to make perfect. But that's not what I'm here to do. I'm here to crack the pavement and make new grounds, you know, sonically and society, culturally 
skrrt skrrt
You've done that with Yeezus. (Yeah) It's fascinating for us to sit here and talk about this record now, because normally when I talk to artists about records of this nature, it's in the lead-up to something. So we're all kind of playing a guessing game, you know what I mean? You could tell me what you think of the record, but I'm trying to find my way around it, the audience probably won't have heard it. In this case, it's been out for a minute, so we can reflect on it with the benefit of hindsight, too. You've seen what everyone else has had to say about this record, both good and bad. But I'm fascinated to know, today, how you would describe Yeezus, as someone who made it. How you would describe that record. You know? 
skrrt skrrt
I just think that I'm a production person, I'm a product guy, I'm a producer. So if I'm working on a John Legend album, I'm gonna try to give John Legend the best home for him to stay in. And I'm gonna try to push Pusha T — no pun intended once again, this keeps happening to me — to make the thing that represents what I like about his music the most. And then for me as Kanye West, I gotta fuck shit up. (laughs) Ah-ha-ha! 
skrrt skrrt
And you did, dude, seriously. From the minute it starts. I mean, seriously. (“On Sight” beginning plays.). It's disgusting 
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Nah. This is me going to the studio with Thomas and Guy-Manuel, who's Daft Punk. They had a synthesizer the size of that wall right there. This is just one session right here. This beat was originally like 14 minutes long, and that part in the beginning was something we completely just distorted, and I ended up making that the intro 
skrrt skrrt
You know, I got a beef with you over this track. It's too short! I wanted more out of it. Cause it's one of the best beats on the record for me, and it feels like you're just getting warmed up. Was that kind of deliberate, you know, to pull back after only a couple of verses and go, you know what, we're going to get on with the album now? 
skrrt skrrt
Nah, it's just what I felt, like it should be 
skrrt skrrt
[Just a dance thing] 
skrrt skrrt
And you know, originally “Blood on the Leaves” was supposed to be first 
skrrt skrrt
Wow 
skrrt skrrt
Which, psychologically, I know would have changed certain Yeezus naysayers about the album. It wasn't that time for me. I – I – I didn't want to come up there and perform. A lot of times, music can be presented as a service position. But I wanted to take a more aggressive approach with music 
You know, people go on a vacation and say, you got the drugs, you got the music, you got the wine? It's in that territory. But I wanted to speak up and say, okay, so my voice is only compressed to express myself artistically through music. It's the only place where I actually have a deal, so I can only consistently make things in music. So I'm gonna take music and I'm gonna try to make it three-dimensional, like – like – like on Star Wars and the hologram'll pop up out of R2D2. I'm gonna try to make something that jumps up and affects you, in a good or bad way. Whether it's, I'm going into a scream in the middle of the track because that's just the way I feel. But I'm not here to make easy listening, you know, easy programmable music 
skrrt skrrt
No. You're so off the reservation on this album in the best possible way. Like you talked about, the way you use your voice in different ways, you don't rely on conventional rhyming flows. Your opening line, “Yeezus season approaching,” you know? “A monster's awoken.” You're laying it out there, this isn't My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy Part 2. I'm wilding out on this record, straight away 
(Interlude plays from “On Sight”). And then from nowhere as well, we just get treated to these wonderful moments where, like you say, it's almost like a collage. Like you're sitting here going, you know, why can't I go into this? Why not? 
skrrt skrrt
You can 
skrrt skrrt
And you did 
skrrt skrrt
That's how life is. It's like a car crash. You could just be driving, and just out of nowhere it happens 
skrrt skrrt
At what point did that very deliberate feel to the record, whereby breaks come in and join this really discordant electronic moments and everything seems to exist in this very – very contradictory but it works kind of way, at what point did that start to take shape? Because it is very omnipresent through the record as a whole, the way it flips between one and the other. Was that in your head early on, or did that come towards the end when you started to reduce the record? 
skrrt skrrt
Well, I didn't reduce it. Rick Rubin reduced it. He's not a producer, he's a reducer. (Laughs) 
skrrt skrrt
Nice – but was it always part of the process for you, to say, why don't I take elements of this and this and just (claps hands) bolt it together? 
skrrt skrrt
Yeah. It's just the way I was consuming information in my life at the time. Negative information to positive information, from the Internet, just going to the Louvre, going to furniture exhibits and understanding that, trying to open up and do interviews with this, learning more about architecture. Taking one thousand meetings, attempting to get backing to do clothing and different things like that. Like, getting no headway whatsoever. It was just that level of frustration. This is what frustration fucking sounds like 
This is what frustration sounds like. Like, for me, as Kanye West, I would not be Kanye West if it wasn't for Michael Jackson. I was with Quincy Jones a couple days ago at John Legend's wedding. Quincy was telling me, it wasn't just Mike, but these guys broke down the barriers. Of course you know Michael Jackson, he had to fight to get his video played because he was black. This is Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson's not even black, he's Michael Jackson — you know what I mean? It's like he's – he's so crazy, how can he even be classified as this black artist? 
So for me, in my life and creativity it's been challenging yeah, it's been challenging and everything. But I was able to ascend to massive heights because of the foundation that my mother and my father and my grandfather laid through civil rights, what Michael Jackson did with music videos and the ground he broke. There would be no Kanye West if it wasn't for Michael Jackson – that allowed him to be that, right? 
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Now let's take people who have issues with me as Kanye West. They classify my motivational speeches as rants – like “Why is he saying that? Why is he doing that?” Well I've reached a point in my life where my Truman Show boat has hit the painting. And I've got to a point that Michael Jackson did not break down. I have reached the glass ceiling – as a creative person, as a celebrity 
When I say that it means I want to do product. I am a product person. Not just clothing but water bottle design, architecture, everything that you could think about. And I've been at it for 10 years, and I look around and I say, “Hey wait a second – there's no one around here in this space that looks like me.” And if they are, they're quiet as fuck! 
So that means – wait a second – now we're seriously in a Civil Rights movement. Like people used to joke about – remember our South Park photo – 
skrrt skrrt
Yeah, I do 
skrrt skrrt
Remember how funny that was? Do you think there would be a Givenchy in the hood if it wasn't for that South Park photo. But no one thinks about that – no one thinks about the names I got called for wearing tight jeans 
skrrt skrrt
You reference that in the record, you talk about that. “No one's liked him since he's been wearing tight jeans.” Everybody knows you brought back real rap. I mean you reference that in the record 
skrrt skrrt
I'm saying y'all had all that, but I brought real rap back. I'm going to do dope things. And I wanna take this opportunity to speak to something, because I go to Hypebeast sometimes to look it up, the new things that're coming out. And every time my name goes up, there's a series of people who write just negative comments – they wanna joke around and say, “Why is he still trying? Why is he doing this?” Why is he – they like diss me as a person for trying. Now mind you, I've brought 10 years of product that has added to humanity 
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
You know, and now, what they don't realize when I say “Hey this is Pusha T, this is what it is” I have to remind Pusha T that he's Pusha T. Because the radio, if they're not playing a song of his that has an R&B hook on it or works at a certain level of trap tempo and plays in [club-live], it's like we forget about that Clipse album that meant everything 
And the reason why I relate it to design and what we do in design is saying that's the music that us as creatives that wanted to get into design – we looked at Clipse as the gods, and this is our soundtrack to creativity. And it's not a trap beat that comes in on that soundtrack to creativity. You know what I'm saying. No knock to trap, cause I did “Can't Tell Me Nothing” – I like it. But it's been commercialized to the point where – and I'm not mentioning no names – but what – but people used to use the term “R&B nigga” but then it was “rappers.” But then rappers didn't wanna be no R&B nigga. Now the rappers is the new R&B niggas! The rapper's the new radio! Like where's the culture at? Where is the culture at? 
So then I scream – and I'm sitting in the middle of it – whether I'm at a dinner with Anna Wintour, or you know, I'm at a listening session with Pusha, or me and Virgil are in Rome giving designs to Fendi over and over and gettin' our designs knocked down. Brought – brought the leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they said no. How many motherfuckers you done seen with a leather jogging pant? Meaning when I see Hedi Slimane and it's all like, “OK this is my take on the world” – yeah he got some nice $5,000 jeans in there, it's some nice ones here and there, some good shit here and there 
But we culture. Rap the new rock n' roll! We culture! Rap is the new rock n' roll! We the rock stars! 
skrrt skrrt
It's been like that now for a minute 
skrrt skrrt
It's been like that for a minute, Hedi Slimane! It's been like that for a minute. We the real rock stars, and I'm the biggest of all of 'em. I'm the number one rock star on the planet 
skrrt skrrt
We are the real rock stars, and I'm the biggest of all of them. I'm the number one rock star on the planet 
skrrt skrrt
There it is. That record, it says that. That's what your album says when you come out, and there were songs on there, you make that very clear 
skrrt skrrt
So what I want to explain to everybody out there, it's like, I make music I can do it, but I shouldn't be limited to only one place of creativity. And it's literally only like one or two or three reasons why I haven't been able to break that down 
skrrt skrrt
But why would you feel that you are, because and I'm just… 
skrrt skrrt
This is the thing you guys don't understand. You guys don't understand. You guys don't understand that I did the Yeezus and they eBay-ed it for $90,000 
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
And people wanted them bad as whatever, right? But I didn't get a call from Nike the next day. You guys don't understand that I've met with companies and they say, “What we're trying to figure out is how we can control you and control that”. If you're a architect, if you're a world builder, if you have all these ideas and you're Gaudi, and you want to build buildings, if you don't ever get that out, what's going to happen? 
skrrt skrrt
Isn't that why you do it? Isn't it the process? Isn't it the point to do it? 
skrrt skrrt
I don't think you're really hearing what I'm saying 
skrrt skrrt
But I'm trying to 
skrrt skrrt
As a creative… 
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
For you to have done something to the level of the Yeezus and not be able to create more and you cannot – you cannot create that on your own, with no support, with no backing. So when I say “clean water was only served to the fairer skinned” what I'm saying is we're making products with chitlins. T-SHIRTS! That's the most we can make! T-shirts. We could have our best perspective on t-shirts. But if it's anything else, your Truman Show boat is hitting the wall 
And what's more important to me about this than everything that I can do sonically and everything is, if I go somewhere and someone says, “Hey, we don't like Kanye West” you've heard that before, right? What people don't realize is I want to make uniforms for my high school basketball team through brand Yeezy. I want to make that one step, and then make another step, and then eventually do uniforms for the entire city 
Then I want those uniforms to be hot and make money and make – that I eventually want to be the anchor and the force behind a billion dollar company and after I make that billion dollar step, then I can go in and say, “Hey I've got an opinion on this and that could be a ten billion dollar step, and I eventually want to be the anchor of the first trillion dollar company 
But when you sit and you have a meeting with a company and show them the most innovative take on theatre because you thought of it one night while you're sitting on top of Watch The Throne set which you designed with Es Devlin, and I designed the set with Es Devlin and I thought of, okay, surround vision, there should be a screen above you, below you, to the left, to the right of you and front of you also. Then I paid my own money that I get paid for doing Gold Digger, which I never really liked that song but I always knew I would get paid for doing Gold Digger 
Then I shoot a film in Qatar with three camera crews, with Nate Brown, Virgil, Matt Williams, Nabil, all of these crew – all of the people that every video that pops up every other day on Hypebeast that's my crew, right? So, we go out and shoot that, three camera crews over five days, edited over 30 days, show it at amfAR – no, show it in Cannes, the night before amfAR on the beach, build it in a pyramid with Rem Koolhaas' agency, design the entire thing, put editors in it, blah blah blah, people give a standing ovation, I do an interview in New York Times the next year to say, “Hey, I did this and I want to let you know I did it”, right? 
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
And then, it doesn't get mentioned in the interview and a week later they do an interview with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg and they're talking about what the next frontier of theatre will be and how it'll be higher priced tickets and it will be something that's surrounding you and blah blah blah, but maybe it's in the goggles, I said, “Wait a second, I just only did the interview to tell people that I invented it. I made it.” 
Like I went, I remember when I was, dropping William Morris, right, and then Sarah Newkirk at that time said “Before you drop them, go meet with Ari Emanuel” and I sat with him and I said, “Ari, I'm an inventor” and he goes on to tell me about the way it works and what he said is “You are a celebrity. So basically what's going to happen is, there's product here, and this is where you end up, right here. If you can communicate this product, you can make money off the product, because look at Gaga. She's the Creative Director of Polaroid.” I like some of the Gaga songs. What the fuck does she know about cameras? 
So it becomes all of this thing where all of the musicians, the musicians try to get more money by promoting other products, right? So you'll say “Hey, you know what? I've got this water and we've got, you know, we've got this red version. We got a red bottle, and we've got a David Beckham version here, then we got a blue version.” So my opinion is no more than the patina on top of it, when I understand the reason from my core of why something should work all the way through 
So, I understand we want to make it about music but I wanted to take this step to say, we got this new thing called “Classism”. It's racism's cousin. This is what we do to hold people back. This is what we do. And we got this other thing that's also been working for a long time where you don't have to be racist anymore it's called “Self-Hate”. It works on itself. It's like real estate of racism. Where, just like that, when someone comes up and says something like “I am a god”, everybody says “Who does he think he is?” I just told you who I thought I was, a god! I just told you! That's who I think I am! Would have been better if I had a song that said, “I am a nigga”? or if I had song that said “I am a gangsta”? or if I had song that said “I am a pimp”? All those colors and patinas fit better on a person like me, right? But to say you are a god? Especially, when you got shipped over to the country that you're in, and your last name is a slave owner's. How could you say that? How could you have that mentality? 
skrrt skrrt
I mean, I know in the past you've talked about, like, you know, building hotels, doing things that are beyond people's normal frame of reference 
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
They know you as Kanye West, an artist. They know that you're moving into fashion, but these things I guess in a way are hard for people to comprehend because they don't have that level of drive. Do you know what that mean? Has it always been like this for you? Have you always felt like you can set your mind to anything and you will achieve it, ultimately? 
skrrt skrrt
I always felt like I could do anything. That's the main thing people are controlled by, thoughts, their perception of themselves. They're slowed down by their perception of themselves. If you're taught you can't do anything you won't do anything. I was taught I could do everything, and I'm Kanye West, aged 36. So just watch the next ten years 
skrrt skrrt
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
skrrt skrrt
One thing I want to express to people also, people think a lot of my motivation is very like megalomaniac, and self-oriented. To the contrary completely I just want to help, from day one, I just wanted to help 
Like my father was a black panther, my father was a journalist, a paparazzi, a photo journalist. He was a paparazzi. We had a dark room in our house. Like seven years ago, he lived in a homeless shelter, not because he was homeless because he wanted to help the ex-drug addicts. He wanted to get that close. He started a foundation called Good Water and moved to the Dominican Republic to help right there, to help with the prostitution, to help with the extortion, to help right there, he stays in Dominican Republic right now. My mom was the first black female chair of the English Department. There is no award show, there is no amount of Billboards, there is nothing that – that can define me or make me pass what my parents made me. And that's exactly who I am. And I put on that pink polo and say broke, broke and broke through the TV and now you got to interview with me. Because their President who is coming out the gate, he was like it ain't going to work, but me I'm here. You know what I mean by I'm here like meaning like I got no play on Yeezus on a radio. Right, no 
skrrt skrrt
No, not entirely true by the way 
skrrt skrrt
A little bit but no number one records, no Kanye West, blah blah right. So then I was going back at forth, with the company I'm in touring right now. And I said I want to perform in the round and then creatively we just couldn't find it, so I said put me against the corner like how we did in Watch the Throne, well just do that instead. They said, well you know we just can't technically do it, because why, technically why. Why can't you do it? They said, look if you do that you are going to be in breach of contract, right. So basically meaning like if I didn't sell the tickets, I would go into debt 
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
So they pushed me – my back against the ropes, right and I said I'll take that chance. I'll take that chance right. So pre-order 9,000 the first day in Chicago doubling Watch the Throne, four pre-orders in one day. That made the people stood up said, we like what Kanye is saying. We like New Slaves 
skrrt skrrt
But we do that all the time 
skrrt skrrt
Yeah, but not through radio 
skrrt skrrt
Well, yet but I'm a radio broadcaster and I love your records. I mean for me… 
skrrt skrrt
No I'm not pin-pointing just you, I'm talking about the overall radio, there is no, “Get Lucky” on the album, and perhaps you know it's just because that just wasn't the song, and maybe it could be that, but it sounds like there's hits on that album to me. But it sounds like this hits that is distracted by the statements “fuck you and your corporation, ya'll niggas can't control me” on the first single 
skrrt skrrt
Yeah I mean this to me sounds like a radio hit where I'm coming from, but you said yourself back in the start, you made a record that was built out of frustration and then you were trying to create cracks in the pavement. I like that description more than you made an album for the radio hits. As a Kanye West fan, I don't turn to your … 
skrrt skrrt
I never described it as an album for the radio hits 
skrrt skrrt
No, no, no, what I'm saying like I preferred than you to describe it as cracks in the pavement than to have made a record just full the radio hits. You know what I mean, I want to hear where you are at 
skrrt skrrt
Pause that, pause that. That song is a hit song, minus the line, “fuck you and your corporation, ya'll niggas can't control me” on your first single 
skrrt skrrt
I think it's a great record 
skrrt skrrt
But you ain't hearing what I am saying 
skrrt skrrt
Go ahead 
skrrt skrrt
That song is a hit record minus, “fuck you and your corporation, ya'll niggas can't control me, said on your first single. Because if you can't control me then you can't control him, then you can't control him, then you can't control him, and then the information age starts, where it occurs while I was talking about starts where Steve Jobs has left as starts. Steve Jobs made the internet usable. This is the information age, we barely scratched the surface 
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
There is things that are moving. The entire music industry was hit by a fucking glacier by the internet and Sean Parker, just like that glacier up in there, and Steve was like no, no, wait a second, come on, give him a little time. There won't be any music, if you just give it away like that. You know what I'm saying, but shit it's changing. People are going to look at this interview and say, “Hey, I understand what he's talking about.” “People are going to look at this interview and say, ‘I don't like Kanye. Look, he looks mad. I don't like his teeth.' They're going to say, ‘Why doesn't he just focus on music? I liked him as music.' They're going to say, ‘Hey, I want the old Kanye, blah blah blah.' But one thing they will do, they will play this interview in five years. They will play this interview in ten years and say, he called that, he called that, he called that, he said that was going to happen, that was going to change 
skrrt skrrt
You're a futurist 
skrrt skrrt
Yeah. I'm a postmodernist, as best as a career. I'm a futurist, mentally 
skrrt skrrt
Talking about the Internet where you feature into that. Obviously, it's just a small part of the future and being a futurist. It's not only just isn't aspect of it. It's changed the way everything moves, but it certainly with regards for music 
skrrt skrrt
It's the biggest part. It's our earth. Like you remember like, that you see future movies and everything was in the sky, like it moved to the sky 
skrrt skrrt
That's where it is 
skrrt skrrt
That's the Internet 
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
That's what it is. That's our sky 
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
That's our future sky. We kind of thought we knew it was in its flying cars. We didn't get flying cars, but we can send movies like in two seconds 
skrrt skrrt
Yeah, it's a very good point. It's a very point 
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
So you talk about it being in its early stages and it being really not even yet at a point where it's developed to its true potential. I mean, what are the key things that you've learned in your journey. I'm fascinated to go down this road for a minute if you want 
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
We could talk about this because I'd love to 
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
But while we hear… 
skrrt skrrt
This record is just the codes of that. Go listen to all my music. It's the codes of self esteem. It's the codes of who you are? If you're a Kanye West fan, you are not a fan of me. You're a fan of yourself. You will believe in yourself. I'm just the expresso. I'm just the shot in the morning to get you going, to make you believe that you could overcome that situation that you are dealing with all the time 
skrrt skrrt
Can I ask you a question about that? 
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I want to talk to you about that aspect of your personality because you said that you're not here to be – talk about you – you're here to help, and I believe you, when you say that man. You know, I think, you know, you've given us great records. You'd like to think about where things are going to appear in the future. You keep your eye on things. You want to make like you said, you want to make basketball tops for you. If you're in high school, you want to do things right 
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Do you allow yourself the time to be good to yourself? Do you allow yourself anytime for yourself at all? Do you know what I mean, I know you've got a good self esteem and who you are, but you seem to be doing a lot for the bigger picture, for everything that's moving around you 
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Do you give yourself time? 
skrrt skrrt
Yeah, it's like family time. Yeah, it's what Kim gave me 
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
She gave me everything. She gave me a family. She gave me a support system. She was in a powerful enough situation, where she could love me without asking me for money, which is really hard for me to find 
skrrt skrrt
Yeah. What are the some other things you know, that you've learned about yourself since you became a family man? 
skrrt skrrt
You know, I can't pinpoint that I don't have the answer right on me. I got to think about a little bit and give you a really good answer 
skrrt skrrt
Okay, cool 
skrrt skrrt
I've got a lock and loaded amount of information that I like to express on a very wide scale that I'll give you. But if you ask me a question like that I'll go back and think of it maybe I'll have an answer for you in a couple of days 
skrrt skrrt
Okay. No problem, no problem 
skrrt skrrt
Yeah. When you get other outlets, you can relax and give other outlets more breathing room, meaning like, okay. When I did the Coachella performance, I had 30 dancers on stage, modern performance artists and I had this lift, and I had the Roman wall and I had like the Celine shirt and above all this types. So when Jay told me to watch it, I always say I didn't want to use dancers of course. And I said, that's fine, because I was doing a fashion show in Paris. So I still had 30 girls on the stage, but you know, I still had these elements of the emotion 
skrrt skrrt
You must have been recognized that wasn't to through anything either I mean, that was I mean this only what throwing was about that type of performance necessarily 
skrrt skrrt
Um, what I'm saying is it's about what I want to make it about. This is my world 
skrrt skrrt
But you're with Jay on this start. It is a collaborative project. It's not just your vision on throwing 
[Kanye West:] Yeah
So then I would have to separate my world, but still get to my world out to the fact that I had a fashion show
You see I'm saying, so it's like right now, people could say oh, he is frustrated, He is that
He is that
No, all I need is the breakthrough
The joint venture for of my clothing, same as Stella McCartney has, same as – I can name so many people
They have joint ventures of backing to be able to express themselves that way
Okay, bam! 
skrrt skrrt
I need that – that outlet, and then, you'll get things closer to watch the throne
You get things closer to bound because obviously people – more people are adept to like ‘Blood on the Leaves' and ‘Bound' and ‘Watch The Throne', it's just more of an overall like"happier vibe, right
But Jay is more realized than me meaning more of his dreams and hopes and aspirations from above has come true and hopefully, God willing, by the time I'm his age, that thing will happen for me also, and I'll be in that place of a more zenned-out place Even it's like I couldn't have done this album without Rick Rubin
I had to have a Zen master come in and say, okay
This is just what we're going to do
You don't realize I am so frustrated, like I am so frustrated
Like I am so – I've got so much, I want to give
I've got ideas on color palettes
I've got ideas on silhouettes and I've got a million people telling me, why I can't do it, you know that I'm not a real designer
I'm not this
I'm not a real rapper either
I'm not a real musician either, like I don't know how to play the piano
Like I'm a artist, I went to Art College
I went to Art College and was looked down like I'm soft because I like wore like Italian clothes You know I'm saying, when I'm rapping in front of camera and my pant is tight, trying to spit a verse for [cam]
You know, that's the same when I'm sitting there, you know, like sitting there at a fashion show
Like I'm there, because I appreciate Phoebe Philo; I appreciate Raf Simons
I appreciate Riccardo Tisci, and I look at them as my peers, as creative people who dedicate their entire life to making something better for the world Let me explain what anybody that knows a artist and you know someone that's giving that
If you know artist, there is only one thing you can say, give or ask them when you see them
There are two words “thank you”
There is no, why didn't you do this? Yo, I want that, what's up – that
skrrt skrrt
We dedicate our entire life to making our current time in civilization better to adding something to the culture, and there is only two words that you can say, “thank you” [Zane Lowe:] Give us an insight to the fashion world though, what you've been going through there with that whole experience
The biggest challenge you've had clearly to get your vision across? [Kanye West:] Yeah [Zane Lowe:] Yeah [Kanye West:] Well, be helping me [Zane Lowe:] Is that partly and please don't take this the wrong way I just mean this in for the process of conversation
Is that partly do you think because some of the people who are making fashion look at you and they go well, you say it yourself they dedicate their whole lives to one thing, you are exceptionally successful and gifted in this area
To move into the area, it's understandable, there is a human aspect of suspicion involved there because they are like “well, hang on a minute, this is our life”
So what is it you are trying to achieve there? Do you think it plays a part of that what's going on do you think? [Kanye West:] I've dedicated the past 10 years of my life to this
I spent 80% of my time working on this, and 20% of my time working on music
Why do you think this song Niggas In Paris is called Niggas In Paris, because Niggas was in Paris, because I had a office and a small courtyard across the street from Colette, where I couldn't even find a good pattern cutter
That's why we were in Paris I put in the 10,000 hours
I've got a very particular, specific take on men's footwear
No one can say I cannot design or understand how to design, a guy's sneaker
When I was in fourth grade, I was drawing Jordans, when my mama couldn't afford them
I was drawing those Jordans, getting kicked out of class for drawing them Over the past few months, the habitués of a central Paris neighborhood, one that's home to many upscale law offices and accounting firms, have been noticing some unusual activity
A chauffeur-driven Porsche Panamera Turbo, painted matte black and resembling a late-model Batmobile, frequently zooms up to an elegant 19th-century building and disgorges various nonlawyer and nonaccountant types, including Kim Kardashian and the rapper Nas
Late at night, thumping hip-hop beats have been emanating from a loftlike apartment within the building, occasionally provoking complaints from the neighbors
If the voice in the songs sounds familiar, it's because it belongs to the notorious man of the house, who's been working on his latest album in a studio he's had installed in the middle of his living room
“There's leaders, and there's followers,” he raps on one track
“I'd rather be a dick than a swallower.”Yes, Kanye West is in town
The rapper–producer–designer–scandal magnet, now a part-time Parisian, is bringing his trademark raw-nerved swagger to one of Europe's most discreet and tradition-bound capitals
But anyone who makes it inside West's apartment will quickly realize that his impact on Paris has been far less consequential than Paris's impact on him
Visits with the Kardashians have been punctuated by the arrivals of people like the haute-minimalist architect Joseph Dirand and the Belgian interior designer and antiques guru Axel Vervoordt, along with deliverymen hauling in West's latest purchases: rare Le Corbusier lamps, Pierre Jeanneret chairs, and obscure body-art journals from Switzerland
For West, it's all part of a crash course in the rarefied upper reaches of design, architecture, and overall good taste
The goal? “To make Kanye West as dope as possible,” he says, sitting in a midcentury swivel chair and wearing a plain dark hoodie and black cotton pants by a label he declines to identify, since he no longer believes in dropping brand names, except for his ownWhen it comes to personal dopeness, of course, West is not known for admitting that there's much room for improvement
Even by hip-hop standards, his boastful self-regard is so extreme that it has inspired several analytical essays and countless jokes, not to mention an entire South Park episode
Addressing the crowds at his concerts this year, West has likened himself to such fellow creative geniuses as Pablo Picasso, Steve Jobs, and Michelangelo
And in the course of our interviews, which take place over several days in March and April, West goes even further, favorably comparing himself to Le Corbusier, the Beatles, Marlon Brando, Tiger Woods, Azzedine Alaïa, Kate Moss, and the Soup Nazi, among othersBut for all his brazen posturing, West,36, is one of the rare top artists in any field who'll eagerly embrace the role of subordinate when he knows he's got something to learn
This is the guy who moved to Rome for four months to work as an intern for Fendi before launching his own fashion line
His current exile in Paris—a town famously lacking in yes-men, where even a star like West is just another outsider who can't get a table at his favorite restaurant if it happens to be full—seems like his latest exercise in self-abnegation, in the name of self-improvement
“In Paris, you're as far as possible from the land of pleasant smiles,” West says
“You can just trip on inspiration—there are so many people here who dedicate their lives to excellence.” And inspiration is particularly crucial to West these days, given his ultimate ambition, which goes way beyond making hit records or developing a discerning eye for console tables
He's plotting to create operas, stores, films, product packaging, amusement parks, and, possibly, entire cities
West is essentially out to redesign the world, if the world will let him do it“How do you spell Mies van der Rohe?” West has logged on to his MacBook Pro laptop—custom-finished in matte black, just like the Porsche—and is Googling modernist architects while playing around with new beats for his album
As usual, there are several collaborators, friends, and minions milling around his living room studio, including the producer No I.D
and the Canadian rapper the Weeknd
When West is at the microphone, alternately freestyle rapping and bouncing up and down, it's clear why his bona fides are unquestioned, at least in the realm of music
He blasts a new track at top volume, and its wailing Deep Purple–esque guitar riffs have the Weeknd holding his head in disbelief
“That shit is awesome,” the Weeknd says
“Just fucking reckless
A lot of people who hate you are just going to hate you so much more.” West says he wants the record—whose title, Yeezus, is a mashup of “Jesus” and West's nickname, Yeezy—to be like a “one-man gangbang.” He plays one intensely dark, primal track that he worked on with the French electro duo Daft Punk: the defiant anthem “I Am a God,” which he debuted live at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute Gala in New York in MayIt turns out this song was inspired by a serious diss—not from another rapper but from a major fashion designer
Last fall, a few days before Paris Fashion Week, West was informed that he'd be invited to a widely anticipated runway show only on the condition that he agree not to attend any other shows
“So the next day I went to the studio with Daft Punk, and I wrote ‘I Am a God,' ” West says
“Cause it's like, Yo! Nobody can tell me where I can and can't go
Man, I'm the No
1 living and breathing rock star
I am Axl Rose; I am Jim Morrison; I am Jimi Hendrix.” West is not smiling as he says this, and his voice is getting louder with each sentence
“You can't say that you love music and then say that Kanye West can't come to your show! To even think they could tell me where I could and couldn't go is just ludicrous
It's blasphemous—to rock ‘n' roll, and to music.”Later, West gives a more measured take on the incident, explaining that he was “just very hurt” by the designer's attempt to control him
“How can someone stop my opportunity to see something that he can teach me, that I can help teach the world?” West asks
But it's precisely those types of outbursts, as well as the tortured semi-apologies that often follow them, that have come to define West's public image
Whether it was his onstage ambush of Taylor Swift at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards (a fiasco that prompted President Obama to call West a jackass) or his declaration during a live telethon for Hurricane Katrina victims that “George Bush doesn't care about black people” (a moment that Bush called the low point of his presidency), West's eruptions have made it all too easy for people to forget that he's spent the past decade creating some of the most brilliantly original music of any genre
Rolling Stone, in its rhapsodic five-star review of 2010's Twisted Fantasy review” My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, lauded him for “blowing past all the rules of hip-hop and pop, even though…he's been the one inventing the rules.” (The reviewer added: “Nobody halfway sane could have made this album.”) Last year in The Atlantic, David Samuels hailed West as “the first true genius of the iPhone era, the Mozart of contemporary American music.” (He also called him “a narcissistic monster.”)Of course, West's bright and dark sides are fully interdependent, and they're equally essential to his art
Both are very much on display during our conversations in Paris
It's a big deal for West to invite a journalist into his house: He hasn't given many interviews in the past few years
This is due in part to a string of PR disasters, the last of which was an on-air clash with Matt Lauer about the George Bush accusation, which led West to cancel a live performance on the Today show
West is especially wary of print interviews, since the writer retains the power to choose which of his quotes are relevant (though at one point he asks me to streamline his more rambling comments or, as he puts it, “to turn my flea market of information into a beautiful living space”)
Another issue: West's opinions evolve so quickly that by the time a profile comes out, he might have totally changed his mind
And finally, there's his self-acknowledged deficiency in the eloquence department
“God's little practical joke on me—as an intellect who doesn't like to read a lot—is like, I'll say some superphilosophical shit, but I'll say it the wrong way,” he says, laughing
“I'll use the wrong word, so it goes from being really special to completely retarded.”For a while, West's communications strategy involved pouring his heart out on Twitter, where his droll one-liners and 80-tweets-in-160-minutes rants earned him almost 10 million followers
But a few months ago, West deleted all his posts
He agreed to do this interview because he feels like he's reaching peak creative potential—“bubbling at the highest level of output”—and he's ready to talk publicly about his thoughts and theories and plans, in entertainment and beyondWest knows the risks of extending himself beyond the music world; he learned that the hard way in 2011, when he debuted his women's fashion line in Paris
Many reviewers panned the collection, deeming it sloppily overwrought and marred by unfortunately placed zippers, but they were kinder about the second, which showed more focus and discipline
West is convinced that the critics got it backward
“The first collection was way better than the second,” he says
“It was more artful
It was 30 collections in one
It just takes time for me to slow down and think like a normal person.” Established designers, West notes, are already “in a position to go crazy
I tried to come out of the gate going crazy
And it didn't work
So now I have to somehow put out something that says, ‘I look sensible!' ” That might be accomplished by his new men's capsule collection of jeans, T-shirts, and hoodies for a hip French brand, to be unveiled in JulyLately, however, West's biggest impact on the fashion world has come not through his designs but through his personal wardrobe choices and those of his equally camera-ready girlfriend, Kim Kardashian
Having evolved beyond his earlier signature looks—the pink polos, the shutter shades—West now favors streetwear crossed with Parisian edge, confidently pairing the right Air Jordans with tuxedo jackets or Givenchy leather pants
And when Kardashian began surprising everyone last winter by stepping out in high-end European labels, she made it known she was dressing to please her man
For some people, that would mean more Victoria's Secret, but pleasing Kanye West these days means more monochromatic and structured looks, more Dries Van Noten
West tells me he hasn't been masterminding Kardashian's makeover to the degree that everyone assumes
“Nobody can tell my girl what to do,” he says
“She just needed to be given some platforms of information to work from.” Since virtually everything Kardashian wears is instantly broadcast around the globe, West adds, “one beautiful thing is that as she discovers it, the world discovers it.” This includes Kardashian's inevitable stumbles
“For her to take that risk in front of the world, it just shows you how much she loves me
And how much she actually loves the opportunity to learn
You got, like, a million companies saying, ‘This is impacting your brand! This is impacting your fans! And blah blah blah.' But she still sees this light of beauty.”One night when I'm scheduled to meet West at his apartment around 10 p.m., I walk in to find some Kardashians in the house
Kim has just headed back to Los Angeles after one of her brief Paris visits, but her brother, Rob, is sprawled on West's gigantic Living Divani sofa with his girlfriend, the English model Naza Jafarian
They both offer friendly handshakes, then return to their smartphones
Next, Kim's mother, Kris Jenner, drops by and looks around the apartment, which she's seeing for the first time
“This is amazing!” she says as West shows her some of his favorite objects, including a new set of ceramic cups by Frances Palmer
Jenner's rapport with West evinces equal parts jokey affection and in-law awkwardness
He plays her some of his unfinished songs, including “Awesome,” which is clearly about Kim
When she exclaims, “Great job!” West doesn't find it as flattering as Jenner evidently intended
He raises his eyebrows
“Great job?” he says and sets off on a comic riff that cracks up everyone in the room
Toasting with his champagne glass, he says, “Great job, Baccarat, for making a glass that can hold liquid!” He looks down at his waist
“Great job, belt loops, for keeping my pants up!” Jenner laughs off the mockery but soon is ready to leave
Hugging West goodbye, she tells him, “I love you
You know where to find us, at the George V
Call us tomorrow, if you want.” It seems apparent to everyone, including Jenner, that West will not callMuch has been written about the celeb mega merger known as Kimye and about whether the match was made in heaven, or hell, or some unknown strange place
Undoubtedly, the West-Kardashian union further validates and indulges both stars' unerring knack for making headlines
But given West's current thirst for refined Euro cool, one might expect him to fall for some chicly cerebral French artist rather than a trash-TV queen who epitomizes the kind of branded mass culture he's rebelling against
West dodges several of my questions about Kardashian and their future child
But when I ask him if he has any qualms about making appearances on shows like Keeping Up With the Kardashians, he says, “Oh, that's just all for love
It's simply that
At a certain point, or always, love is more important than any branding, or any set of cool people, or attempting to impress anyone
Because true love is just the way you feel.” Some intellectual ambivalence clearly remains, however
“Thoughts and feelings can disagree sometimes,” West saysKanye West has been married for ten days, and he has that new-husband way with the ring still, pulling it on and off like it's something he might yet undo, or do again
The ring is gold," and understated in a way that not much else about Kanye West is
He sits in the lobby of New York's Mercer Hotel—the same hotel where he and Jay Z recorded most of Watch the Throne—reflecting on the distance he's come
""""I am a black American male from Chicago", West says," """"who had my rehearsal dinner at Versailles and then got married in Florence with a view of the entire city."""""He is one year removed from Yeezus, the record that took all of West's prodigious pop gifts and made a show of immolating them one by one
He is one year removed from telling anyone who'd listen that he was going to burn the entire fashion industry down, or at least he would once they let him through the door
Now they kind of have: He's got a capsule collection with A.P.C
out now; a line with Adidas that debuts with footwear this fall; and somewhere off in the distance, a new menswear line
He's also got a new record—maybe even a full-on pop record," though he hasn't decided yet
He knows he is no longer the most popular man in rap
""""Currently that spot is taken"," West says
""""Let's be honest—he got last summer."""""Who?"You know
There's only one person."""""Drake?"Yeah
He got last summer
And I'd never given it up till last summer."""" Now he's thinking about taking it back
""""It's a real question for me
Do I want to?"""""Meanwhile," he's reckoning with what it is to be a father and a husband and a decent human
He's happier now—""""You see I haven't name-dropped and said a bunch of negative stuff about people", he says at one point—but no less homicidally competitive or less convinced that he's the next Steve Jobs
He'd like to spend more time with his family
He'd also still like to build amusement parks
It's a contradiction, one he's only begun to resolve
And all the while, he can't go outside with his wife, Kim Kardashian, without having his photo taken
His entire waking life has become a performance, a manifesto, a fashion shootMost of the time," he's cool with that fact
But not always
""""I hope we don't see no paparazzi today"," West says
""""Because I'm still getting acquainted with these jogging pants I threw on
Like"," 'That's not my statement!' """""You got married a week ago
You're the lead subject in practically every tabloid on the planet right now
Are you comfortable in that position, having that many eyes on you?That wasn't my goal
My goal is just to be respected as a man when I walk down the street with my family
I don't care what your job is, you're not gonna talk down to me, you're not gonna try to get a rise out of me
I'm a man first
And in establishing that, some interesting things have happened
[laughs]Like that TMZ video from last year, where you're walking with your pregnant fiancée with your head down to avoid the paparazzi, to the point where you walked into a sign and hit your head
Then TMZ made fun of you for walking into the sign
How do you live like that?It's difficult
And then put on top of that the idea of going and taking meetings with people, and people say," """"We don't want to work with you"," because we saw you get mad about running into the sign."""""Does that kind of mockery feel like an effort to de-fang you?But also, there's no fangs
I don't have fangs
I'm a porcupine
skrrt skrrt
Like, I'm a—what's the fish that blows up?A blowfish?Yeah
skrrt skrrt
I'm not a shark, I'm a blowfish
So that perfect example about me hitting my head, it's like a blowfish
I wasn't coming out of my house going to a paparazzi's house to attack them
I'm defending my family in front of my own house
I'm defending my name as someone's screaming something negative at me
That's a blowfish
People have me pinned as a shark or a predator in some way, and in no way am I that
I wouldn't want to hurt anyone
I want to defend people
I want to help peopleCan I read you something? The New York Post's Page Six has an account of your wedding that reads," in part: """"Kanye returned one hour before the wedding and didn't like the all-white bar that was in front of the Gold Toilet Tower
He took a saw and started sawing it in half himself
Two men held the bar stable as he sawed", and sawed, into the bar, defacing the entire front, screaming at everyone around him
He said it looked like a bar from Texas
Then he ordered two pieces of raw wood to be nailed onto the front of the bar
Once the wood was in place, 'Now,' he said," 'it's art.' The Italian construction teams looked at this guy and couldn't believe what they were seeing."""""For the person that wrote that, were they involved with anything last year that was as culturally significant as the Yeezus tour or that album? They didn't even talk there about the photographs, or the dress, or Andrea Bocelli singing," or the marble tables
They're like: """"It's a gold toilet."""" No
The bathrooms—that usually would be a porta-potty—were wrapped in a fabric that was neutral to match the fort
The bar was terrible", and the wedding planner didn't approve it with me
I was having issues with this wedding planner the entire time on approvals, and I get there and they threw some weird plastic bar there
So the same materials that were used to cover the bathroom, we said," """"Let's just use that"," because this is all we have to make the bar look better."""" Which it did", in the end
And anyone knows that you cannot pick up tools yourself, because of—what are those rules about the workers?Unions?Yeah, unions
You can't do that
It's illegal
That's falseThen they say you gave a forty-five-minute toast to yourselfAnd what I talked about in it was the idea of celebrity, and celebrities being treated like blacks were in the '60s, having no rights, and the fact that people can slander your name
I said that in the toast
And I had to say this in a position where I, from the art world, am marrying Kim
And how we're going to fight to raise the respect level for celebrities so that my daughter can live a more normal life
She didn't choose to be a celebrity
But she is
So I'm going to fight to make sure she has a better lifeHow does it feel when you read something like that account of your wedding or you see a photo of you looking glum at a zipline go viral?My feelings don't matter anymoreOf course they doNo
One of the things that I said at the speech was," anyone that's at this table has had to defend me or Kim or both of us at some point in their life
Ask a boxer: """"In the third round", when he hit you from the side on your ear," how did that specifically feel?"""" You wouldn't ask a boxer that
Because you know they're there to fight
Meaning now you know I'm here to fight
I'm here to fight for the re-education of what celebrity is
To say"," """"Yes", we are celebrities, but yes, we're also innovators, we're also inventors," we're also thoughtful."""""But that's sad to me
You should be able to be a human with feelings, tooThat's fine
But that's not the case, is it?Is that the way you feel, that you're always in the ring?Yeah
I'm sitting right here, it's a fight
I'm fighting with the way I line my words up together and the way I place a sweater on top of a T-shirt
At this point, people know what's up
People know I'm smart
And people know that, whether it's SNL or Jimmy Kimmel, it's a trend to take the piss out of celebrity—just as much of a trend as wearing a gray hoodie or driving a PriusBut you voluntarily married into a celebrity family, right? In 2014, there are no bigger tabloid stars than Kim KardashianIn the speech, I talked about the idea of collaboration and all the people involved working together and being able to change things
Meaning there was a time for two or three years where fashion designers wouldn't give Kim dresses
There was a time they wouldn't even let me be at shows
Now the idea that Kim is in a Givenchy Couture dress is raising the communication
Because people would be more apt to be like," """"Celebrities don't really have style
Celebrities can't dress
Celebrities are less educated."""" But they haven't had the chance to be able to break through and have Carine Roitfeld sitting right there
Carine Roitfeld is the Walt Disney of what Tumblr is today
She is the Kanye West of what Tumblr is today
She's the single most important person to what street style is today
And she was at the wedding seven seats down from Kim", who is one of the number one fashion plates of today
So I said," """"Wow", Carine is seven seats down from Kim
Farnaz [Farjam], the producer of the Kardashians and the producer of The Real World, is four seats down from [director] Steve McQueen
And four seats," because in between them is Hosain [Rahman] from Jawbone."""" This is what I talked about
That was not a forty-five-minute speech to myself
Do you realize what that means for those people to be in that close of a proximity to each other?"But if you read a lot of the tabloid coverage, the implication is: Kim and her family are bringing you down
Jay Z and Beyoncé didn't show up at your wedding because of them
That kind of thingAll that, I wouldn't even speak on
It doesn't even matter to me whatsoever, who would show up
Because the most important person to show up there, to me, was Kim
And that's all that matters to me
I had to fight for that for seven years
But the fact that these other people showed up that are from such different worlds but have done such dynamic things—they're all, in a way, equal to what Kim has done in TV or what I had done in music
I was so moved that I just wanted people to stop and think they weren't sitting at a table full of fashion people, they weren't sitting at a table full of celebrities, they weren't sitting at a table full of movie directors
It really was a representation of the way we receive information today, post-Internet
And so Page Six can't overshadow the main point: Carine Roitfeld was sitting next to Kim Kardashian
That alone to me is like the same moment when I brought Mos Def to the studio with Jay Z
It's about the people, and the fact that they're from different walks of life, and that they're working together and not discriminating against each other
There was a class system, and now there's a creative class system, and I think that's what you were talking about a bit—the class system of creativityAnd my point was, they leave Kim out of itAnd my point is, they were all at her weddingA skeptic would say that's because of youBut when an Instagram photo gets 2.3 million likes—Your wedding photo, which is currently the most liked photo on Instagram ever.That's because of who?I don't knowDon't say you don't know! It's because of Kim
Meaning there's no photo that I would have put up by myself, or next to one of my smarty friends, that would have got that amount of likes
So now you take this photo that has that amount of likes, and it has a flower wall from the same guy who does the Lanvin shows, and it has a couture Givenchy dress and Givenchy tuxedo in it
That's the point
Now the thing that is the most popular is also communicating the highest level of creativity
The concept of Kimye has more cultural significance than what Page Six could writeWhy'd you decide to get married?"Saying """"Hey"," I like Kim"""" isn't as inspiring to people as us getting married
And anyone that's in a relationship knows that in order to get to the point to get married and then to be married and to then carry on", it needs that work put into it
Right now, people look at it and it's like," """"Wow"," that's inspiring."""" Meaning that love is infectious
You know", God is infectious—God flowing through us and us being little-baby creators and shit
But His energy and His love and what He wants us to have as people and the way He wants us to love each other, that is infectious
Like they said in Step Brothers: Never lose your dinosaur
This is the ultimate example of a person never losing his dinosaur
Meaning that even as I grew in cultural awareness and respect and was put higher in the class system in some way for being this musician, I never lost my dinosaurKim is this girl who fucking turns me on
I love her
This is who I want to be next to and be around
And then people would try to say," """"Well", you know, if you're a musician, you should be with a musician, and if you want to design," you need to be with a girl from the design world."""" I don't give a fuck about people's opinions
Because when a kid falls in love with an airplane or a bike or a dinosaur—especially if you're an only child and it's not because of the book that the sibling was reading—it's like", fuck, you mean to tell me that the dinosaurs walked the earth and stuff like that?! That's amazing! You mean to tell me that these giant multi-ton crafts can fly that fast and that loud, and they can flip, and there's danger, the possibility of them exploding? That's fucking cool! You mean to tell me that this girl with this fucking body and this face is also into style, and she's a nice person, and she has her own money and is family-oriented? That's just as cool as a fucking fighter jet or dinosaur! And just as rarely seenThat's a lovely way of putting itI feel like you're stronger as a team
Because when you know you have a team player, it's not one on the world anymore
At least it's two on the worldTwo and a half, if you want to count your daughterYeah, and then two and a half, eventually
It's like having some eyes in the back of your head
That's one reason why, when people try to spoof or talk shit, it's like: But you're mad because basically Kim is the type of girl that, her entire life, if you were in school with her, most people would be studying and up late nights, but for some reason she would have the skill set to go and grab the one book, turn to the exact page, and just magically say," """"That's the exact answer."""" Or she could wink at the person who had done all the work and get it done anyway
And the point of life is getting shit done and being happy"PARIS — Fashion has a new odd couple: Bernard Arnault and Kanye WestThe luxury titan turned out Saturday night for an impromptu concert by West in the auditorium of his Fondation Louis Vuitton, the new Frank Gehry art destination that later this month will put on display Edvard Munch's “The Scream,” Henri Matisse's “Dance” and other modern masterpiecesWest drew a crowd packed in like sardines — the kind that hold cell phones — to hear him proclaim, “I wanna thank my original family for having me this evening, the LVMH group,” as he ripped into a version of “Runaway,” the lyrics of which include the refrain, “Let's have a toast to the jerk-offs/That'll never take work off.”The young crowd went wild, with Oscar-winning film director and video artist Steve McQueen twirling his scarf over his head up in the VIP box“He's great,” Arnault said after the show, giving a thumbs-up sign and heading to West's dressing room to offer congratulations, his classical pianist wife Hélène and four of his five children in towIt was Alexandre Arnault,22, formerly a DJ, who pulled off the four-night attraction in the middle of Paris Fashion Week
“We organized it in two days,” he saidThe student and budding luxury executive, who already works on LVMH's digital strategy, related that West also offered to premiere his new music video, “All Day,” directed by McQueen“You saw the film? Fantastic,” Bernard Arnault told a reporter before the concert, which also featured an exhibition of West portraits by photographer Jackie NickersonMcQueen related how the project came about“Me and my daughter were shopping in London at Dover Street Market and I got a phone call from Kanye and he says, ‘I'm at Dover Street Market, where are you?' and I said, ‘Hey, I'm at Dover Street Market,'” he recalled
“I always said I would never shoot a music video, and here we did one in 10 days
That's Kanye: It's been a wild ride.”The director said West played him his entire forthcoming album, “So Help Me God,” and he decided to blend elements of two tracks, shooting the video at Chatham Dockyard, with West donning a vintage T-shirt, Acne Jeans and his new Kanye West x Adidas Originals Yeezy high-topsIn an interview after his performance, his wife Kim Kardashian curled up on a sofa manipulating her iPhones, West was unequivocal about how fashion shows, particularly in Paris, nourish his creativityKanye West on Why He Doesn't Care About His Legacy Every time I crashed the internet, it's like, this little drop of truth
Every time I say something that's extremely truthful out loud, it literally breaks the internet
So what are we getting all of the rest of the time?I don't care about having a legacy, I don't care about being remembered
The most important thing to me is like while I'm here, while we're having fun, while we're going to sleep, in breathing oxygen and living life and falling in love and having pain and having joy is like what can I do, what can I do with my voice, what can we do for each other to make life easier, to make life doper for our kids, you know, as they grow
You know, we were born into a broken world, we're like the cleanup crew, you knowMy mother made me believe in me
When I was growing up I wanted make video games
My mom got this Amiga computer when I was in seventh grade and it had 4,096 colors
I found myself running home to use this sound program that allowed me to place in notes, it would stay, place another note
It would stay, place another note, and it's how I learned how to produce
In seventh grade I was just really making music to make video games
They just let me dream, they supported me, they pushed me, they didn't set me up to be inside of a box
Weston main thing that makes magic magic - the fact that no one believes it's possibleEnvy: Special guest here this morningCharlamagne Tha God: He's Back!Envy: He's back! Kanye WestKanye West: WassupEnvy: I didn't think it was gonna happen, I said I bet Kanye's not gonna come back up here I thought it was a wrapKW: I'm coming back every timeCTG: Let me start with some positivity," man
I think """"Only One"""" and """"Wolves"""" is dope records"KW: Oh wow thank you!CTG: I think they're really dope tunesKW: YeahAngela Yee: This is starting way different than the last one!(All laughing)"KW: But! But! I don't like """"FourFiveSeconds""""! And why did you do that at the Grammys? (laughing)""CTG: I do like """"FourFiveSeconds"""" though"AY: He loved that song"CTG: I don't like the auto-tune when you sing but I like """"FourFiveSeconds"""""KW: I don't like auto tune either but I need itCTG: Really? Why? I hear people say that, why?KW: Cause, I could do, I can like bend my voice in other ways, like at the end of Runaway and everything? I like to do thatCTG: I got you
And thank you for inviting me to the fashion show as wellKW: YeahCTG: I didn't feel like I belonged thereAY: We thought it was a set up, he's gonna walk in (laughing)Envy: We definitely thought it was a set up, we said he's gonna get beat up in there, he's gonna get jumpedCTG: I felt like it was only right
You came here, you know what I'm saying? Through all the slander, why wouldn't I come to the fashion show?KW: YeahEnvy: You put him next to Drake which was kind of awkwardCTG: They didn't put me next to Drake
I went to stand in the back and Drake happened to be back thereAY: Charlamagne was standing by Drake the whole timeEnvy: Now lets talk about your shoes that just been released, Yeezy BoostsKW: Yeah I heard y'all don't like thoseAY: No not y'all, I said that I actually have a pair of shoes that look like them and I like themCTG: That's not a good thing when a girl has shoes that look like mens shoesAY: Why?CTG: I like the black colour
The grey colour when I first saw them looked like a paper mache project
But the black ones look toughKW: Yeah we coming with the black ones real soonAY: But that is a big accomplishment for you, you put that out, limited run at first, and they sold out and now people are buying them online for over $1500Envy: 1500 for themKW: yeah see I don't want them to be limited, that's something that the company did
I wanted as many people to get them as possible
And I don't want the price to be $350, I don't want to play this sneaker culture game and all this where they be reselling them for higher prices and stuff, I just want people to have what I make
There's no limited release to the College Dropout, or a limited release of Graduation
You know and I think in clothing right now there's a real separatism, there's $5000 sweat shirts everybody spending that money trying to show up in the club, and act like they.
You know what I'm saying? We need to spend that money on our families
My point, and what I'm doing in clothing right now is I'm going and taking the talent
I came from the Ralph show and I was talking to Ralph like man, I need your help, cause you know how to make clothes and I think I know what my generation wants
But it's very difficult if you don't have that production and that experience that Ralph has
and it's really difficult to get those price points, you know the Zara and H&M price points if you don't got the factories, if you don't got the boats
You know I talked about this beforeCTG: So why is it $350? Cause it's hard to..KW: I have no idea they just priced it that
I think they just, I think their logic was they didn't want it to go from um, the other company and go to Adidas and be like man, why they drop the price? Cause sometimes the public won't always understand the transition
Like Steve Jobs always had the iPad in his head, but he couldn't do it coming from a keyboard and a floppy disk to the iPad, he has to walk people in to thisEnvy: I thought the whole idea of you going to Adidas was you would have more control, and it was your ish, and you could do everythingCTG: Over price pointsKW: Yeah I do have a lot more, at least I could do something! But any relationship that starts off you ain't gonna have all the control
You know what I'm saying? It's a marriage
Usually the first year of any situation is the toughest, and then when you guys start to communicate, you know it cane be powerfulEnvy: Now explain this to me
I'm a sneakerhead, I have tonnes of sneakers
I assumed it to be like, I don't like to compare, but the other sneakers you did, like leather, they were more of a sneaker sneaker, like you could ball out in your others sneakers, this one I don't think I could play basketball inKW: You actually could play basketball in this one better
Because first of all its got boosts which is the best technology and I'm not just saying that contractually with Adidias, I'm saying that from someone that goes to the gym, and if I'm wearing that like my Boosts actually I feel better cause I have problems with the back of my achilles from performing so muchCTG: I did say fat girls with cankles, it look like they'll be comfortable for themKW: Yeah! I mean people joke that they look sorta like the Uggs, right? But what's really bugged out is I'm actually working on trying to make a sexier Ugg
Cause you see Uggs all the timeEnvy: They are comfortableKW: And I see, you know, I see stuff for the future
I'm always, I'm such a futurist that I have to slow down and talk in the present
This was a proposition to where I think shoes will go
I think the colour palates, with the red over here and the thirty different colours, the Black History Month version and all that, I think that's gonna be out of there in the future
This is for me, as humbly I would say I am the most influential person in footwear right nowCTG: There's no way to humbly say thatKW: Well truthfully, I am the most influential person in footwear
[?]Envy: Those are re-releases but when it comes to new sneakers I think he isAY: How hard is it to get that balance between wanting to get something people can afford, but then also wanting to use those materials and make things really special, you know things that make them more for youKW: Yeah those materials is all a game that the factories play too
Silk is in style, silk is more expensive from the factories
You can get everything for a better price, it's all in how you negotiate with the factories
And my end goal, ten years from now will be to have everything at a Zara level, like I think when Steve made it with phones, it wasn't a show of class anymore
You know you had the Vertu phone, the $4000 phone you felt like you was better than somebodyCTG: I don't understand this talk at all [?]KW: The phone, I'm talking about the vertu phoneCTG: Oh phones!KW: Yeah I'm not clear a speaker, you know I had this car accident and everything and I just and ever since then I've been a mumble mouth
But what I'm saying is, people are trying to put on a jacket to try and act like they are better than you
I think this idea of being better than the next man is the wrong mentality in the first place
We were born in to a broken world that has been separated by race, religion and classCTG: But you confuse me when you say stuff like that cause you do act like you are better than peopleKW: NoCTG: Like the Grammy's is a great example, when you run up there and tell everyone respect the artistry, but it's like you're not respecting the artistryKW: Yeah that
And I deserved it that was completely hypocritical
I'm go ahead and tell y'all like the other day
I went to dinner and I sat down with Taylor Swift, right, and ironically they were playing the Beck albumAY: Ironically or you think they did that on purpose?KW: No they did it on purpose so I could finally hear it and I was like manCTG: So you hadn't even heard it when you did the Grammy rant?KW: I was like man, this is like kinda good, I ain't gonna lie(All laughing)CTG: So you hadn't even heard the Beck album when you did the rant?KW: Nah! I hadn't even heard it man, I just(all laughing)AY: Charlamagne you do that all the time, you say somebody is wack without hearing the albumCTG: But I admit it! When did I do that? That's not true
I can't even say if Beck didn't deserve it cause I didn't hear itAY: And that was an argument we had cause I was like Kanye might not know, a lot of people hadn't even heard Beck, I'd never heard it, so
People were saying no I'm sure he heard it, he had to have heard it to say thatKW: You know what? I bet you the album is really good
I'm gonna listen to the album and maybe it was potentially an album of the year but the Grammy's still have a commercial component to it
They wanna sell commercials, so they have these big superstars sitting in the audience and they're advertising they're performing 'coming up next' that's what they try to do to get those views
You don't have these people sitting here and you know, have them and their hearts beating and stuff like we work too hard for all that, to be losing in a situation where, cause I mean who's winning? We don't get none of that advertising money
Y'all don't play with us
That's what my main point itCTG: Why you think superstars go where they're tolerated, like yourself you go where you're tolerated but not celebrated
You don't come to the Soul Train awards, or the BET Hip Hop awards, you'll hear 'Kanye won' but Kanye is not here to accept this awardKW: That's why we need to support the people that support us, and not just particularly a black thing
We always say this is a black show, you know it's gonna be a while
I ain't got the answers on how to change the voting system, I ain't got the answers on how to make it everyone is honoured in the proper way, and sometimes maybe there's two people that should win
Who's to say who should win? But I think it'd be a class thing to
You know it carries more weight if you win a Grammy than if you win a BET award, so we still goCTG: Says who though?KW: Says society
And this is what this is about, this is why I respect this show because this is the voice of society, this is I'd say the voice of the barber shop, this the voice of the streets, and you know the Grammy's are, it's a statement of classicism
Like if you go to my house Imma hit the stunt button for a second
You see my 21 Grammy's laid out that my wife forced me to take out of the bathroom and put in one placeCTG: That's why it's interesting to hear you get at the Grammy's cause you could be selfish and say 'well I've got 21, whatever'KW: Yeah I mean I think I deserve more(All laughing)KW: You know it's all, like I said we was born into a world that's separated by class, race, and religion
So class is one of the things people want, you want to be first class, but in a plane crash everybody dead
It ain't no class then, it's just a whole crash
Some of the things, when I first came out with the idea of DONDA and I was tweeting out all these idea; airplane design, this design, this design
You know you see of course like me and Kim, we can take private but we really wanna be in the airport, we wanna be next to the people
I get inspiration when I see what people are wearing, I get inspiration when I see what people are going through
I see people walking a line slower or getting patted down, you know I gotta tell you this one good story about class
I was going to London where I'm going tonight, and I was in the first class line and it was real crowded
And I looked at the coach line for customs and it was completely empty
We went over to the coach line and got through right away
And everybody that's sitting there with their Hermes belts and their big hats, they didn't want to lower they class in order to get through faster when time is the only luxury
It's a lot of stuff that I've been learning over the past couple of years and I've used my money and my position and my relationships to learn about class and I think my approach is I think more, Robin Hood nowCTG: Its more ghetto
Even though you're getting up in class its still rachetKW: Yeah I guess
I mean ghetto is fun
I'm from Chicago, my wife got a big ass, we stay ghettoEnvy: Did you reach out to Beck after though? Did you reach out to Beck after you heard his album like maybe I slipped up a little bit, maybe I went too far?KW: Yes I got his number and I was supposed to call but I keep forgettingAY: What? You did not forget, you just don't know what to sayCTG: Don't feel bad because I thought Beck was a beer until you jumped on thereAY: Beck was very humble about it though, he agreed
He was like ‘Yeah I mean, Beyonce should've won' it wasn't like he disagreed with you
But I felt bad for himKW: No I felt good for him because think of all the good stuff that happen to me in the past 7 days, 8 days
The person that won the most is Beck
Because if I hadn't done that then his album of the year would have never been mentioned
Now its in all the chatter; ‘Kanye West Messes Up Again' ‘Kanye West Donkey of the Day'
You know I'm already the enemy so you can't get no worse than the villainAY: It has to be hard to win an award and have all these different people saying you shouldn't have won
And then you have the Beehive going in and leaving negative nasty comments and how terrible he isCTG: Well its all subjective thoughKW: Yeah it is all subjective butBut you know, he should win an award for what he did
You know, rock album or something like that
But he shouldn't have won that award in my opinion
But who am I to have an opinon
Ya know?CTG: You're Kanye WestKW: ExactlyCTG: If you don't respect it then it's not to be respected
But one thing we always ask in the barbershops is why is Kanye always caping for Beyonce? I love Beyonce, I'm a Pinkett-Smith-Winfrey-Knowles-Carter, but it seems like you're always coming to her aid
And nobody, Beyonce don't need no caping she's BeyonceKW: I know it's really ironic that it's always Beyonce for some reason
Why is It Beyonce? Why don't I go off on whoever going off on my wife on twitter? I think Beyonce is a great representation of an artist working hard and trying their best and getting the results from it
So say Beyonce's previous album wasn't as well received as this new album, and she got low like how I got low on my new album, and delivered something that everybody loved
In America we have to respect greatness when we see it and we can't smack it in the face at the cost of some votes splitting, at the cost of blowing someone who can sell some t-shirts
If you see something that's great, you got to respect it
I remember I was trying to get on the basketball team in 8th grade, I hit every free throw, hit every layup, and I looked on the list and I wasn't on the list
And the coach just gave me the Kanye shrug[Laughter]KW: You know that's like the best thing cause you get to leave school...AY: Get all the chicksKW: Yeah
We had a small gym, where like you'd run into a broadway stage like if you hit a layup and stuffCTG: So hurt people hurt people
He probably said ‘Kanye I'mma let you finish but you're not going to make this basketball teamKW: Now my point is, you not gonna have somebody hit all the shots and you not give them that credit
And I think a lot of times its exactly what you say, Beyonce don't need no help
People look at Beyonce cause she's rich, respect to Hov she's a beautiful woman, she's talented
And so they figure she's got everything and so you don't even need nothing else
But I think she deserves the proper accolades because she's an inspirationCTG: She got 20 Grammys! 21..20?AY: Not album of the yearCM: I thought she did win that one went there for album of the yearKW: I don't think she's ever one an album of the year Grammy
And this is funny because Taylor was talking to me about this
She was saying that when she was the victim she won every award and now that she's powerful and the biggest selling artist, now she's not winning awards anymore," cause they're like """"what do you need?"""" It's once again", it's that moment where the rich people, our line is getting clogged up because it's a practical joke that everybody in the airport is playing on the rich people, as they should, because as rich people, our focus shouldn't be on how we get a new Phantom, how we get a bigger house
Our focus should be on how do we help the middle to the lower class to have a better life
And I think that we get distracted with luxury, so-called luxury goods, so-called luxury cars, like..
And I embrace this, any time a rich person gets the piss taken out of them it's cool, don't do it to me all the time and stuff but...CTG: But you know that's always what we felt about you because you used to speak up like when you said George Bush don't care about black people, you were speaking up for the have-nots
But now it seems like you were just fighting for the civil rights of rich people lately
(Laughter)KW: I think it's the rights of everyone
And another thing that I used to get really caught up on was with race
You know, with race it's like, okay we know it's racist people, we know that a lot of white men over the age of 60 are racist, we embrace that
We know that a lot of people that are in power don't really..
they're like Donald Sterling
We understand that
We know that, but the world is moving
10 years from now, 20 years from now, every person of color or female or any minority that comes into power will eventually shift it
You got the ozone layer, you got all this stuff you see 100 years from now the entire world might be black
Just to even survive on the earth, periodEnvy: Now you mentioned you stood up for Beyoncé, people asked, you stood up for Beyoncé, you stand up for her maybe more than you stand up for your own wife
Recently, people been going at your wife crazy, from the Paper magazine cover, they say," """"Why would she do that? She has money", is it just for fame? Is it just for Instagram? Is it just for attention? You know even Amber Rose came on the program a couple of days ago and said your wife was fake
How do you reply to all of these people and what do you say to everybody? Even with us, when we seen her on the cover it was kind of like, yo Kim is filthy, you know, she has a child, she has a family, why would she do that cover?KW: Which question..
let's do the cover first
One of the things in breaking class is respected art can break class
So one of the things that shut up a lot of people is the fact that Jean-Paul Goude took the photograph, that used to shoot Grace Jones
And Grace Jones' figure, physique was as new and different as Kim's physique was
And our position of power, we're not gonna accept the physique that was given to us
You know, that was told to us that was the proper way to look
My daughter has a chance of being shaped like my wife, so until she, between this age and 'til the age she's like that, I'm gonna be fighting for that shape to be considered the highest of class
Or not the highest of class, at least equal to what someone looks at, like a skinny model for
My first introduction, one of my first introductions to beauty was the Helmut Newton book, this really big book, and every woman in there was naked
This is a straight photographer, he did Playboy and he'll do St
Laurent ads and the highest level taste, and I was really drawn to the beauty of the way their photographs were set up and to the fact that I was attracted to the women also
I liked the two things at once
I like the physical attraction and I like the way the shot was set up
I think that with my wife, it had been a lot of times earlier in her career where she didn't have the access to that level of photographer, of course he's passed away now
So now that she has the access to a Jean-Paul Goude, a Steven Klein, a [?], I can name all the really high level, Jackie Nicholson, all the high level photographers, now, you know it's important for her to stand, I think, for her to stand up in all of her glory and all her power
Now her power is in her body, is in her nudity
Her power is in her mind, her power is in her family, but body is one of the powersCTG: What happens when she gets older, though?KW: Well, she's got, she gon' always have that body but she's gonna have mind, family, and she's gonna create a legacyCTG: You know, you name all those brands and stuff but the hood don't know that so the hood, the hood is like," """"Kanye"," just tell your wife she don't gotta get naked no more."""""KW: But, she can get naked if she wants to, it's not illegal to get naked and, you know, and then think about this, like if Adam had never ate the apple, we'd all be naked
So...CTG: You hit us with that last time, I still have not understood that one in two years
I've been tryna figure that one out for two yearsAY: But listen, do you feel compelled to reach out to Amber Rose, being that that's your ex-girlfriend and saying," """"Listen", calm it down," leave my wife alone and just chill out.""""?"KW: She's just soaking in the moment, nobody feel compelled to do nothing
If Kim had dated me when I first wanted to be with her, it wouldn't be an Amber Rose
You know what I'm saying? Like..
(laughter)Envy: So it's your fault, Kim, it's your fault
He holla'd at you beforeCTG: But Amber said Kim was sending you naked pictures while y'all was together thoughKW: I wish
I would have gladly, happily have liked to
Cause by the way it's very hard for a woman to want to be with someone that's with Amber Rose so she wasn't sending nothing, you know what I'm saying? Like I had to take thirty showers before I got with Kim, you know? (Laughter) I'm sorry, please.
wait, don't ask me no more cause I just wanna be respectful, manCTG: Listen, I saw you say, I was watching something on TV and they said you were saying that fashion lines didn't want to deal with you cause you were married to a reality show star
Just on a business level, cause personally we can tell you're happy, just on a business level do you feel the Kardashian brand has hurt Kanye West's brand?KW: No, it's helped
Cause it just showed, like, my ability to bring Mos Def into the studio with Jay Z
My ability to bridge the gap
To bridge, you know, somebody's sitting over at this lunch table, they're the fashion world, they're all cool and stuff and somebody's sitting over at this lunch table, they're a celebrity and they have a perception about that
And you know, I showed people the power of what happens when you work together
And now, you know, Kim can sell a dress faster than any magazine coverAY: And you got her on the cover of Vogue which is something we thought was never gonna happen, the way that Anna Wintour felt and how she had expressed that in the pastEnvy: What did she say? She said something today or earlier today?AY: Oh about bringing North West to the fashion show
That was alleged though, they said allegedly she said that's not the proper place for a child
You know?KW: Yeah I can't speak on alleged commentsCTG: Does it bother you when you see the news and they're like," """"North West was crying at a fashion show""""", I mean she's a baby, that's what babies doAY: And she's at her daddy's fashion show, which makes sense, I mean I think you would want your daughter front row at your fashion showKW: Yeah, yeah, I mean think about it, no one can tell me where to have my child or not, you know?Envy: I got four of them and they cry
You can't tell them when to cry or when not to cry, they gon' cryCTG: Dame Dash at the BET Awards, BET Honors
Why'd you let him present you with that award?KW: Because he presented me to the world
You know, I wouldn't have a record deal if it wasn't for Dame DashEnvy: How was that first conversation? Cause at one time he hated you, well I'm not gonna say he hated you but he was very upsetAY: I don't think he hated you, he just felt you weren't loyal to himKW: And I wasn't, and this was an extremely visionary move on my part to move with, to roll with Jay ZEnvy: It was a smart move"CTG: Did you tell Dame that? If he's the one that believed in you then why does Hov get the credit and the """"Big Brother"""" records?"KW: I mean, I mention Dame a lot in raps, but you know, the story is not done
You know, sometimes it's been moments where like I was wildin' out and Jay was like," """"Ye you got to sit this down right now"," sit these couple plays out"""" and you know", it was the moment when Roc-a-fella split
It made more sense for me career-wise to roll with Jay even though Dame had supported me
And I wonder, I say, where would we be, you know, if I had rolled with Dame? Would we have been, would I have been more successful? Would I have been less successful? I can't say, but at that time, you know, I came to Roc-a-fella because Jay Z was my idol
And it would have been very hard for me, you know, at that young state where I was to separate from my idol
You know, and that's the decision I made and then do I say there was some disloyalty or not? Yeah, I own up to that
Is it anything that me and Dame could do together now to make money? I think so
Will I do it?CTG: He's got a film company, right?KW: Yeah we're gonna work on films and actually I really like the films that he's doing
He had all types of ideas and Dame is like the original person who understood culture and really was in it in every situation and would go, you know, Beans had a problem, he would go pick Beans up
He'd have us on a jet with them, talking to us direct, talking to me and GLC directly
He was talking to me about GLC with the film company," like """"Yo we gotta put out GLC's album""""", you know just kind of reminding me, similar to what you was saying last time we was talking about having the real niggas, you definitely got to say Dame's a real nigga
So when he came over to the crib and I just saw him, I missed him, man I missed the good, I missed the bad, I missed all of that because all of that is what created College Dropout
That tension, all of that is what created Late Registration
And we creating something new now in the fashion world and in the film worldEnvy: We realized the other day that you still have a love for music and the reason I say that is I don't know who we were talking to (Tyga), we was talking to Tyga, we was talking to Ty Dolla $ign, and I heard a remix with so many different people, and it's like Kanye's in the studio working with everybodyCTG: You've always got the new guys that may not even be next in the studio with you so you keep your ear to the streetsKW: You know I just gotta, I have to work
You know I think a lot of times people get rich, people get comfortable, people fall in love and everything
You know, I went to this Drake concert in Germany
I flew to the concert to go see it
And he got this one line where he say like, something about people be falling in love with famous girls and dadada and they don't have be working as much
And he rapped it, and then when he rapped it he knew I was in the concert so he like looked down and stuff"CTG: """"Too in love with fashion and women"""" or something like that"KW: Yeah something like that but you know," he was right
You know what I'm saying? I gotta get on my job and that's why I got on the end of that """"Blessed."""" Hello", I'm back! We back in the studio, it's times that I gotta go pick my daughter up and take her to dance class in the morning and I try to create a regiment, but at least if I go to the studio like 6 hours a day
And it's funny cause when I first sat with Tyga, like me and Virgil seen Tyga at the Balmain store and we knew he was fresh
You know, certain people, they have a certain talent with clothing: a Tyga, A$AP Rocky
Certain people got a certain talent with the bars and shit: Young Thug, Big Sean
You know, and I sat in the studio with, it was me, Thug, Sean, Travi$, Tyga, and I was just saying how we gotta bring our resources together
We have to see how we can help each other to make each other way fresher, share information, build, have cyphers like back in the Wu-Tang era," like people used to have cyphers
So last night when I working on """"All Day"""" at Q-Tip's house", it was like me, Vic Mensa, Q-Tip, and we was just building on culture, culture, culture and instead of trying to write bars, we built on that and then I started writing the bars
Then they started coming and we started bouncing ideas off each other so with me, I'm only a humble servant
If you have power you have to empower
You have the power to give power away, what I said on the song," """"Power."""" """"No one man should have all that power"""" is a true statement
No man has the power", the power is in the people
The people give you the power
The people chose me to be the people's champ
Soon as I go up and talk about," """"I", I, me," me"""" you lose that
And then you got next generations", you got, no matter how I hard I try, Drake is gonna speak to a generation in a way that I might not have been at that same basketball game he was at
That same high school game, watched that same TV show, went to that same club
Tyga's gonna speak to a certain generation, Big Sean's gonna speak to a certain generation, and it's important for a revolution, like Common said on that song he just won for, it's the youth and the OGs have to come together
You need the energy of the youth and the knowledge of the OGs
skrrt skrrt
CTG: That's in the Bible, old men for council, young men for warKW: That's why I sit with Puff, I sit with Dame, I sit with Jay, I sit with Farrakhan
I talk to the OGs and try to figure out how we can help each otherCTG: Now with Tyga, mentioning Tyga, you're executive producing his album
Do you feel like his relationship with your sister-in-law is inappropriate?KW: I think that, that's a good question right there
I think he got in early, I think he was smart
(Laughter)CTG: I told him he's redshirting her, and I said that's a great redshirt prospect, and let's be clear, Russell was 35 when he met Kimora, she was 17
But I'm from the south too so I don't knowKW: They're closer in age than a lot of relationships that I know, you know?CTG: He's 25, she'll be 18 in AugustKanye: OK, dope
You still got the Nashville number?Taylor: I still have the Nashville area code but I had to change itKanye: For all my south side niggas that know me best, I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex.Taylor: I'm like this close to overexposure.Kanye: Oh well this one is, uh — I think this is a really cool thing to have.Taylor: I know! I mean it's like a compliment kind of.Kanye: What I give a fuck about is just you as a person, and as a friend.Taylor: That's sweet.Kanye: I want things that make you feel good
I don't wanna do rap that makes people feel bad.Taylor: Um, yea
I mean, go with whatever line you think is better
It's obviously very tongue in cheek either way.Taylor: And I really appreciate you telling me about it, that's really nice!Kanye: Yea
I just felt I had a responsibility to you as a friend
I mean, thanks for being so cool about it.Taylor: Aw, thanks! Yeah I really appreciate it
Like, the heads up is so nice!"Kanye West and his creative enterprise DONDA have officially launched the GOOD Music Merchandise online store featuring multiple designs on everything from socks to snapbacks
After recently opening the Yeezus Tour Pop-Up Shop (curiously placed right next to the Kardashian trio's """"D-A-S-H"""" store)", Yeezus has dropped a whole new line of merchandise in support of his record label and newest enterprise in DONDA
The GOOD Music merchandise online store features all black and white items and some of the merchandise has even been worn by Yeezy himself.Recently," West spoke in an interview with Power 106's Big Boy Neighborhood denouncing high-fashion company Louis-Vuitton claiming their prices were """"too extreme."""""Bu rap tanrısı şeyi zenciBütün orospu çocuklarını yere çakıyorumAyeRah, rah, rahRah, rahGözler kapalı, bir şeyleri görKüçümse, kıvırıyorumBenim ucube rüyalarımdasınBenim ucube rüyalarımdasınÇılgın orospu, bundan zevk alıyorsunBinler kazan, araba sürSikini dışarı çıkar, hiçbir şeyi siklemeMemeler dışarıda, hassiktirSikim dışarıda, şimdi yalayabilir mi?Siktir, şimdi sikişebilir mi?İki kere sormaktan sıkıldımFiyatları biraz indirir misiniz?Lil Boosie'nin pantolonu yerlerdeKafam biraz güzel ama iyiyimŞimdi sikişsek?Şimdi sikişsek?Şimdi, tam şimdi sikişsek?[Kanye West]Kimin hatası?Hadi suçlama oyunu oynayalım, seni seviyorum, fazlasıylaHadi suçlama oyunu oynayalım, kesinlikleHadi isimlerin dışında seslenelim, isimlerin, senden nefret ediyorum, fazlasıylaHadi isimlerin dışında seslenelim, isimlerin, kesinlikle"Sana kısaca """"sürtük"""" diye sesleneceğim"Son bir çare gibi, benim ilk sonucum"Sen beni uzunca """"orospu çocuğu"""" diye çağırıyorsun"Bunun sonunda, sen bizim yanlış olduğumuzu biliyorsunAma ben suçlama oyununu oynamayı seviyorum, seni fazlasıyla seviyorumHadi suçlama oyunu oynayalım, kesinlikleHadi onun(kızın) isimlerini seslenelim, isimlerini, senden nefret ediyorum, fazlasıylaHadi onun(kızın) isimlerini seslenelim, isimlerini, kesinlikleBanyo duvarına yazdım"Başkasıyla olmaktansa seninle tartışmayı tercih ederim.""""""İşiyorum ve """"siktir et"""" diyip savıyorum"Ve gittim ve başka birini buldumTartışmayı siktir edip ve duyguları biçiyorumYo, ben lanet olası kendimle olmayı tercih ederimSaat gece 2'ye kadar ve ben geri arıyorumVe telefonu kapatıyor ve de kendimi suçlamaya başlıyorumBiri yardım etsin...Ama ben suçlama oyununu oynamayı seviyorum, seni fazlasıyla seviyorumHadi suçlama oyunu oynayalım, kesinlikleHadi onun(kızın) isimlerini seslenelim, isimlerini, senden nefret ediyorum, fazlasıylaHadi onun(kızın) isimlerini seslenelim, isimlerini, kesinlikleMükemmel değildin ama hayatı değerli yaptınAyrılmıyorum, bazı gerçek duygular yüzeye çıkabilirSeninle banyoda konuştuğumdan beri uzun zaman olduSeni kavrıyorum, beceriyor ve boğuyorumNe sikim yapmam gerekiyordu?Biliyorum sen bu tip bir aleti bu yerli züppeden elde etmedinVe eğer sen, umarım sen iyi bir zaman geçiriyorsundurÇünkü ben kesinlikle benimkiyle geçiriyorumVe sen önemli bir adamın duygusallaşmasını görmeyi düzeltmiyorsunHerzaman diğer zencilerin seni okşadığı hakkında şeyler duyuyorumYalan söylüyorsun, sana vurduğumu söylüyorsun, o oturup seni teselli ediyorİsmimi doğrudan çamurlamaya çalışıyor, seni uyandıran kim?Minnettar olmalısın, benim gibi bir zenci seni hiç farketmezdiŞimdi sen farkedilebilirsin ama hiçkimse senin kontrolünü ele geçiremezSaat gece 1 ve kimse seni alıkoyamaz"Erkek kardeşinin telefonunu arıyorum sanki """"ne yapmam gerekiyordu?"""" gibi"Hatta bildiğim halde, o hiç doğruyu söylemediO sadece senin ona söylediğin herhangi birşeyi söyleyecektiBelli bir noktada soru sormayı bırakmıştımSiz birbirinizi kirletiyorsunuz, tıpkı çamur güreşçileri gibiOnun benim paramla biraz kokain aldığını duyuyorumBu doğru değil kızımBu beyaz kız(kokain) için para sızdırıyorsun"Sen herzaman """"Yeezy"," ben senin dürüst kızın değilim."""" dedin"Sen muhtemelen onlardan birisini bulacaksın," """"Sanatı seviyorum."""" tip kızları"Işıkların tümü, o aldatıcı bir kız olarak yakalandıBen aşkın içinde yalanla birlikte memnun olmuş biriyimŞimdi kim suçlanıyor, sen suçlanıyosun, ben suçlanıyorumYağmur yağdığında acı için dökülerek yağarHadi suçlama oyunu oynayalımAma ben suçlama oyununu oynamayı seviyorum, seni fazlasıyla seviyorumHadi suçlama oyunu oynayalım, kesinlikleHadi onun(kızın) isimlerini seslenelim, isimlerini, senden nefret ediyorum, fazlasıylaHadi onun(kızın) isimlerini seslenelim, isimlerini, kesinlikleAnd the Grammy goes to..

It was a five, I'd give it
So I do want to ask you one more thing about the tweets because I just want to be clear-- bring up that...yeah, that--do you really think I look like SpongeBob? [Kanye] It's the first thing that came to my mind
[Kimmel] Where were you when you were writing those tweets
I like to imagine, on the toilet
[Kanye]Yeah, that's when I think of the best shit
I was just at my place here, my old home here in LA
As we were writing it, there was a frustration I was getting out, but also they were really funny to me as I was writing it, and I just thought it was so amazing that I was saying this in real time, in real life
You know, with my position, people are so scared to say anything, you know, as soon as you're a celebrity, you're not to say anything anymore
But just to completely wild out… The only reason I could do that is because we could speak on a similar level, and we can go back and forth
[Kimmel] It was a crazy thing, to see that happen, as far as just the technology, and all of a sudden, everyone in the country knew you and I were having a really dumb fight
[Kanye]I just thought that that was amazing, to crack media, in a way
You know, I feel that media does everything they can to break creatives, to break artists, to break people's spirits, and I do everything I can to break media
[Kimmel] From my standpoint, sometimes I'll think of things and maybe it's two o'clock in the morning on Saturday night, and my wife will go, “Don't tweet that
Do not tweet that.” Because people take things out of context, but you just do it, you don't care
[Kanye] You shoulda saw the second set of tweets… [Kimmel] Save them for next time
I do just want to say congratulations on your new baby
In fact, I brought you a little gift
I made fun of this, but there really is such a thing as leather jogging pants, and there's some tiny little leather jogging pants [Kanye] Fashion isn't always practical
It's more about emotion, it's more about swag
It's more about, you know, pussy
It's more about, like, club
It's more about style and stuff
Jimmy Kimmel: My guest tonight is a 21-time Grammy award winning performer, who last month threatened his very existence by threatening one of America's most beloved television personalities
We had a big dumb fight on Twitter, but he was nice enough to agree to come and talk about it tonight
Please welcome Kanye West![Kanye enters]JK: How are you? Kanye West: I'm okay
JK: I'm very happy that you came
I'm glad you did, and I wanted to clear this up
I really felt bad about all this stuff
I did
KW: Mm-hmm
[Laughter] JK: I guess the first question I should ask is, who are you wearing? KW: It's Ralph
JK: Kramden? Lauren? JK: Is that a new grill you have there? KW: Nah they've been in my mouth for three years
JK: That one on the bottom? OK well it's good to see you
KW: Good seeing you too
JK: I guess we should talk about what happened, because I do think that somewhere in you, you want people to understand where you're coming from is that true? KW: Yeah, correct
JK: So we did a sketch on the show where we had - you did an interview with the BBC Radio and it was an intense interview - and I'll be honest with you, I only saw a couple of little parts of the [Zane Lowe] interview when we did this sketch
KW: Yeah, that's what I thought
JK: In fairness, there was context to it and we took it out of context
And we had a couple of little kids reenact it
Which I didn't think would be something that bothered you
Do you mind if we show a little clip of it? Little Kanye: I've reached a point in my life where my Truman Show boat has hit the painting
I'm not trying to regurgitate myself
I'm a product person: not just clothing, but water bottle design, architecture, anything you could think about! Brought the leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they said no! How many motherfuckers have you done seen with leather jogging pants?! JK: I'm gonna tell you something, the truth is the main reason I did that is because I like to see kids curse
I think it's funny
(*Kanye laughs*) And I think that some people read into it differently that we were positioning you as a child, but that's not true
In fact, we've done this to other people, with Lady Gaga, with quite a few people that we've had kids say what they said and reenact them
Of course this is not something you knew
And this is not something that people who just watched it online or whatever knew
And you called me
A lot of people think this is some kind of publicity stunt that you and I cooked up
But this isn't, right? KW: I mean everyone out there in TV world, real world, whatever world you stay in, needs to know that I've never done a publicity stunt in my life
Any time I went up and spoke my mind, whether it put my career in jeopardy or whatever someone so called said, it was always what I thought was the truth
Whether I'm like reading from through a teleprompter or whatever I felt emotionally
I don't follow like rules of normal celebrity or what their publicist tells them to say
So I don't do publicity stunts, period
So don't ever think that
JK: Me neither guys
(Laughter) So we talked on the phone, and I didn't really know why you were calling
I heard you were upset
But I didn't know the context, and we had a bad conversation, right?

In the process, you've become incredibly influential
So you talk about doing all of these other things, which is great, but there's really no amount of money that could make you more influential than you are now
So my question is: What are you going to do with all of the influence that you have right now?WEST: Well, influence isn't my definition of success—it's a by-product of my creativity
I just want to create more
I would be fine with making less money
I actually spend the majority of my money attempting to create more things
Not buying things or solidifying myself or trying to make my house bigger, or trying to show people how many Louis Vuitton bags I can get, or buying my way to a good seat at the table
My definition of success, again, is getting my ideas out there
The first company that has really given me a shot is Adidas
They did the deal ..
I mean, Damon Dash did the deal, at the end of the day
He signed Kanye West 12 years ago
What does that mean now? What does that mean to music? You know, people say things about creativity and jobs and every 10 years, blah, blah, blah
But I don't have a desire to not continue making music
When I left Chicago and moved to New York, it wasn't because I didn't love Chicago; it was because I needed to go to New York
So right now, I've got other innovations and other thoughts that I want to pursue
As I was saying earlier, I create like a 3-year-old
When you're 3, you wake up one morning and say," """"I wanna ride a bike."""" And then the next day", you wake up and say," """"I wanna draw."""" I don't want to be in a situation where", because I was good enough at riding a bike one day, then that's all I can do for the rest of my life
I mean, you know firsthand, being a fine artist and then moving into the Hollywood space ..
You know, I say to Renzo Rosso, Bernard Arnault, and François-Henri Pinault, the heads of Diesel, LVMH, and Kering," """"Come to my show and look at the mountain I made
Look at these 20",000 people screaming," and then tell me I don't deserve to design a T-shirt."""" If I want to design a T-shirt in my lifetime", then please help me do it! People say," """"Well"," why don't you just do it on your own?"""" Are you telling me to sew every single T-shirt? People say"," """"Why do you antagonize the high-end companies and your fan base?"""" and this and that
But what I'm saying is that in working with partners like Louis Vuitton and Zanotti and Balmain and Fendi like I have—and please forgive me for using film as a metaphor because I hate when people do that with music—I feel like it's a better form of film that I'm working with when I work with them
I'm working with better cameras
I'm working with better editors ..
Steve", please forgive me because I feel like it's super-patronizing whenever someone does an analogy or a metaphor that relates to the field that you currently work inMCQUEEN: No, not at allWEST: I'm sorry
I find it super-insulting whenever people give me a music analogy
It's like," """"You know", I would have understood it if you just said it in English
You didn't have to put it in music terms," like you somehow know more about music or I would understand it better if it were in music terms."""" So please forgive me for putting that in film terms
I mean", talking about film to Steve McQueen ...MCQUEEN: [laughs] I grew up in Europe, in London, and you grew up in the States
When was the first time you came to Europe? Do you remember?WEST: I think it was when Damon Dash had me and some other Roc-A-Fella artists come over
He stressed the importance of connecting with London, especially
Then we went to France, and I hated France when we first went there
Now, of course, I love it
But at the time, there was a rapper out of Chicago who wanted me to show up at some event of his, and he was trying to threaten me in some way physically if I didn't show up because we had done a record together
And Dame Dash had to man-up on the situation and apply a bit of gangster to have them fall back, just for me to be able to get on that first flight to LondonVerse 1:You a cutie, you big bootyChorus:///bounce ya booty bounce ya titties///Please, let me testifyYou accused me of another manBefore you lock my love awayLet me take the witness standI'm innocent, ohhhh!I'm innocent (Ooh, ooh)'Til proven guilty('Til proven guilty)Before you lock my love away(Don't lock my love away)Please hear what I have to say(Hear what I have to say)Oh, I'm innocent (Ooh, ooh)'Til proven guilty('Til proven guilty)Darling, it's the law of the land(Don't lock my love away)Don't punish me until you understandYou're accusing me of being unfaithfulDarling, I'm innocent of your charge(I'm innocent)This case is based of a line testimonyOf a jealous witness who wants your heartCan't you see that she wants you?(She wants you)All my tears in vain(Tears in vain)I swear on a stack of burdensDarling, I've been framedI'm innocent, ohhhhh!I'm innocent (Ooh, ooh)'Til proven guilty('Til proven guilty)Before you lock my love away(Don't lock my love away)Please hear what I have to say(Hear what I have to say)[N-Trip Verse]Jewels, jewels, jewels, jewels, jewelsThis net's been thrown over far more than our schoolCause you know this artificer he ain't no foolSo shine a light on this jewel, you reflect onto me and me back to you, and we asking who'll work for that net, under Vishnu, and all that he do

But when we start making fires
We get ever so hot
Whether we like it or not
They say we can love who we trust
But what is love without lust
Two hearts with accurate devotions
And what are feelings without emotions?
[Refrain: La Roux]
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
I'm going in and I'ma go hard
I mean what's the point if it ain't no scars
A little teeth marks
Blood on the collar
That's real love, mmhmm ahhnah
She said uh
How could you love someone that hurt you, played you, spoke to provoke you
How could you love someone that burns you, turns you into a werewolf
And in the moment you might do some things you're not aware of
No one's prepared for the scale of this, and now you fear love
And war and war and more and more drama looking for a score
State you're looking for a tour
Her allure is more couture, tailor-made
'Til your screams in rage
Said I'd be gone by five
But it's sun rise and I'm still in your bed

We used to talk 'til midnight
All those days that you stayed at my house
We were just passing the time
When we were young and we ain't had no vows
Now, now, now maybe later on, I'll text you and maybe you'll reply
We both know we had no patience together day and night
Getting high on our supply, yeah, we ain't satisfied
I could love you all occasions
skrrt skrrt
Hello, you thereâ€¦?
(Yeah, I’m hereâ€¦!)
You breaking up, I can barely hear you
Naw, you clear
You cool? you mad?
You talk? bad
You up? You been good?
Naw I been bad
What you mean, you been bad?
Baby girl you know I got bad nerves
Got me cursing with the kids in the car
â€œMommy, daddy using bad words!â€
No more tripping while you at work
No more texting while I’m at church
No more switching up the password
That’s the shit that get your ass hurtâ€¦!

See I hustle like a predator and prey on the weak
And playin for keeps, cause see, it's a thin red line
Between a nigga gettin his, and me gettin mine
And plus I'm a nigga with that feelin like it's my time
And anybody standin in the way of that is dyin
I bust nine, how many times I gotta warn you?
I ain't the one, be pushin buttons in the sight of my gun

Lou Stoppard:
Kanye West, welcome to SHOWstudio. We're gonna be answering questions from some of your fans, some of your friends, some of your peers. But the first question I wanna ask you, it's actually from me, so Lou from London. You're one of the most famous men in the world and I think everyone has an opinion about you - I really noticed that as we were preparing for this interview. Everyone thinks they know you. I've watched quite a lot of your interviews recently and you've really talked about this idea of not being heard. There's quite an irony to that cause you have such a huge direct reach, but I got the sense you've really felt you were not being listened to or not being understood. Do you think everyone fully understands Kanye West? Or do you think you're very different to your public persona? Have you created that in some way?
skrrt skrrt
Yeah, I think there's people who understand. They see it. That's the same people who see an earthquake coming on, or see a tsunami coming. I think there's people who don't want to embrace what it really is so they use their position of like class, or snobbery, or whatever comments they have, to just try to always down things and to not give it its just due, or just opportunity as a form of discrimination. You know, most people don't understand who they are. So people's misunderstanding to me is a misunderstanding to themselves. That they don't understand that he's not being the projected version of himself. He's not what he was taught by current society or taught by this lifetime. He's evoking something from another place and this is unfamiliar; it's alien to us. You know, it's easier for us shun it, than to really try to dig deeper and find out more about it. It's funny that so many people that are supposed to be like so super educated love to just pick the lowest hanging fruit of a concept of fame or celebrity. as a way to diminish or to take away the validation of what is being done up to this point and what will be done in the future.
LS: Talking about what you did in the past and what you want to do in the future. A question that was submitted by one of you fans, Sam Hollis. He said, what do you consider your greatest contribution to music, but also your greatest contribution to creativity?
KW: Well, I'm answering the second question first. The greatest contribution to creativity is taking away the bullying. Well, I'm sure that I've bullied myself sometimes, but taking away people being able to bully you because you're a creative. We're bullied and controlled by organisations and money and the people with money are in power. And that's gonna change after me and Kim's lifetime. It's gonna go more back to when people used to philosophise and talk about proportions and shape and colour and what we can do for the next generations, but right now it's all about what people can do to make the most money and how they can not cut in creatives in any profit and use creatives against themselves in a way. Like if they know someone is a genius but not business smart, they take advantage of that. So, me constantly fighting that on the front line I think is the greatest thing I've tried to open up, so that creatives can be more empowered, because I believe the world can be saved or helped, and the world meaning us as human beings, our civilisation, us as a race, as one race, can be helped through allowing people with more positive motives, who see more colours than just green. To help be at least a part of the conversation and be heard and listened to. What was the first question?
LS: It was about your greatest contribution to music, but maybe you don't think like that anymore?
KW: Yeah… music synthesis. Just to synthesise. To take Mos Def and bring him to the studio with Jay Z, I think is the greatest... When people say ‘oh this is backpack or this is gangster,' or to go on tour with Roc-A-Fella with a chain and have people boo me and be like ‘Roc-A-Fella is not hip hop' and fight against that. Now, it's considered to be one art form. Like what Louise Wilson would always talk about, there's this juxtaposition, high, low, these opposites and combining them. This combination that makes a greater civilisation and a greater human being. The actual human being a thousand years from now, generally, as a race we should be far advanced. Like at the beginning of ‘Prometheus', like how that guy was just like *chtchhhhhe noise*. He was like Mike Tyson meets Steve Jobs meets Shakespeare as a person. There was a time when people were working on multiple things and have multiple art forms and businesses and different things that they could do but now you're only supposed to be able to do one thing and in the future, people will be highly skilled in a lot of things because they won't be afraid to fight for their education
LS: I think it makes people uncomfortable, doesn't it, when people try and kind of get themselves out of their box. They see musicians as musicians and when you do fashion it makes people annetuate. This relates to a question that came in from Nick Knight - he runs SHOWstudio, who you collaborate with a lot. He talks about your bravery. He said you seem, sort of, be open to make very brave decisions. And I think in some points that relates to pushing yourself into new arenas. He gave examples like opening Black Skinhead with three black KKK hoods and not putting New Slaves on YouTube or appearing naked in the Black Skinhead video. He's interested, do these decisions feel brave at the time? Do you feel brave? And maybe what's the bravest thing you've ever done?
KW: I mean, there's nothing to be afraid of, really. I don't ever wanna take to much credit for being brave. That's just a responsibility of ours, as artists, to give our truth at time. And it's just as simple as that. Soldiers are brave, they have a serious responsibility to go fight for their countries, police officers are brave, fire fighters, it's their responsibility to go into a fire. And for the rest, an artist's responsibility to give our truth. I just think more than courage or bravery, it's just, I...
LS: Honesty?
KW: Yeah, honesty. Maybe the answer didn't... some answers I'm gonna give are not gonna make complete sense, if you're a very literal-by-the-book person. You might find a flaw in the final finishing. I suppose you understand the just of what I'm saying. And, you know, the other day I came up with an equation that explains the way visionaries think, I suppose to very calculated people. As someone as you, get 2 and 3, most people will say 5. If you put 2 and 3 in front of me, I'm gonna say: well, 2 plus 3 is five, 2 times 3 is 6, 2 divided by 3 is this and 3 divided by 2 is that and then come up with an average of all those things. And then when you say 5.76 blah blah blah, that's the thing that people marvel at. Like, wow, that really was not what I was expecting or not what we wanted to put you in a box for. But I felt I got something more out of it and that is the calculation of the Zeitgeist. Because everything changes, every day something changes. People get so caught up in the embarrasment of changing their mind in front of someone. And one thing can change everything. So you have to put that, as a part of your 2 and 3. You don't have to, I have put it as a part of my 2 and 3 equation.
LS: It's interesting you use the world visionary there. A lot of our viewers, they ask questions about that term and about the term 'creative genius'. Sam Thompson, he has this question where he said, you've called yourself that and equated yourself to these different people; Da Vinci, Walt Disney, Steve Jobs, Michaelangelo. He asks, how would you define a genius in that context? But also, why do you feel the need to call yourself that?
KW: Because otherwise I'm called celebrity. I'm called nigger. I'm called rapper. And when they use the word celebrity, nigger, rapper, isn't that in a positive way. And all these things, all these words, can be used in an extremely positive way: ""what's up my nigger"", you know. But that's not the way it's used. So I have to define who I am. All of my aspirations are the things that currently only sixty-year old white people do. So I have to redefine and let people know exactly who I am and it's not letting them know by, you know, wearing a suit or letting them know by wearing a Rolex or letting them know by bragging about how much money a sponsorship made on top of a rap. It's letting them know by saying, ""let's start with this, I'm a creative genius"". *Laughs* It's proven and now we'll continue to prove it. When people try to take the piss out of me for clothing and this and that. They never think about the fact that I've never had the opportunity to be properly educated and if given the meanings to be properly educated or given the proper support groups, I would completely shhh, light the lights up. We sell shoes that people wanna line up for because we put love in them, we put heart in them, we want to make Christmas presents, we want to make something that people want so bad that it hurts them if they can't have it. It not a... it's not a... just a financial oppertunity, cause you need finances. But it's a form of discrimination and racism, especially with blacks and fashion. And it literally, you know, it took me, being Kanye West, to get this far in fashion. Meaning, I was being able to become a multimiljonair and invest in myself, because no one else would have. I got this employee, that's a black guy and there will be, sometimes there will be a piece of misinformation. Three weeks later he'll tell me something and he says it kinda, like, with his voice down. I remember being with my dad and my dad was the type of dad that would be everybody's dad. A guy would come in and sell some cookies, but my dad was a sellsman also. So he's saying, ""excuse me, I got these cookies"" and he'd say ""yo, sir, pick your head up and explain to me what you wanna say and what you wanna sell"". This guy, this employee, because blacks especially in America have been raised with slave mentality, don't feel they have the right to speak as loud as possible. And everytime you hear a black person speaking as loud as possible, it's after someone's gotta say ""look at this niggers over there"". So if you don't want to be called a name in a derogatory way. You'd rather put it in what's people's favorite word to use for me? Humble? But if we go on your iPhone on a dictionary and look up the word humble, eighty procent of the definition is negative. It's a controlling word. It's a way to control the masses and to control the sheep. Yeah, I think there's a level of reality to being nice, to being cordial to people. But if you have the ability to lead, you are a leader. You have the answers or you have the ability to find people with the answers and your will is to help. You should not be humble, you should speak up, because this world is broken. So someone needs to say something and sometimes I just feel like the only one that's not crazy.
LS: I want to ask you a question that's relatable to what you were saying. The question came in quite a lot, but it was posted particularly nicely by Aravin Sandran, he's 25 and from London. And he said, ""do you think the resistance and criticisms to your work is being partly because you're a black man. Would your ideas and work received differently if you were a white man?""
KW: If I was a white man that became a really successful musician, that box would have put me in a chamber that would have said that I shouldn't work. So there's a lot of white people that if they're really super good at something, they also get discriminated against in another field. You could be a photographer and someone would say you can't be an artist. You could be a designer and someone would say you can't be a musician or someone would say you can't be a film director. As far as the advantages in life, yes, if you are born white, you have that on your gene pool. Currently because the world is controlled by whites, you have that as a 100, as an advantage, and if you add a couple of other things to it, you have a very high chance of success. Whereas, because the world is run by whites currently, if you're born black, if you make it to something like the Met Ball or the Grammys, most likely you've done ten times the amount of everyone else there to get there.
LS: It's interesting, Simon Foxton, who's a stylist. I know you know his work. Asks the question that relates as well. He said, your clothing line has been greeted with a lot of harsh criticism. Do you reflect like a lot of designers do, where they take that criticism and they use it to kind of develop their aesthetic and change their work? So do you do that? Or does it just make you even more convinced in your belief and vision?
KW: Yeah, I'm convinced that I know what I like and I know that I just know. I know and I don't care. I don't care because anyone that is criticising, most likely they saw the 350s and acted like they didn't like them because they're racist and discriminatory. They're not only racist against black people; they discriminate against celebrity. They discriminate against people with multiple art forms. Or they could say, ‘Oh wait a second, that cut wasn't that good,' but they do enough to throw a stab at, ‘Oh that didn't fall the right way' or ‘That wasn't styled the right way.' But they didn't do the research on how difficult it was to one by one put together a design team and to fight against the idea of celebrity, to get overcharged because you're a musician or people feel like you have money, to get completely taxed by the fashion world. And I love it because it's like going to Harvard. That's the reason why I'm in fashion. I think it's the ultimate training because I dropped out of art school. Eventually, I got a PHD this year, like a honorary PHD at the Art Institute of Chicago. I dropped out of that school and I wanted to go back to the school of hard knocks. Right now, in all honesty... You know whatever the fuck I'm going to say today, I'm going to say it and I'm just gonna fucking own it and that's how I feel right now. If I feel differently in three years, I'll tell you how I feel... but right now, the highest art form is actually fashion. What's funny about that is people in art look down at fashion designers. It's like a class... I mean, where's architecture? The most energy currently is around fashion because with music, it's in question if a song is popular, if that person is really a good artist or not. In fashion, for the most part, if someone is really popular, it's because it's agreed upon that they're an amazing artist. They're amazing at what they've done. People do the history on what their background is. Did they intern for Christian Lacroix? Did they work at Margiela for a period? They find out what the history is and see if that someone is making a connection to something that is current, that's relative, that is in touch. And fashion designers are superstars currently too. It feels like hip-hop felt to me in the nineties. It's like, me, I'm a hip-hop artist but it's like why are you going to the fashion world? I mean it's just a really interesting art form. It's just a different art form. Business is an art, the way you talk to people is art, an interview can be an art, everything is a form of art. I appreciate the critics because when I see the collection I just did and when I used the stretch French Terry that I found in Japan and I use on market canvas, like heavyweight canvas, and I put it in my colour palette and I see 64 different tones come down together, you know, I've created like a moving expressionist painting and that satisfies me. So if someone was to go up to a Monet and say, ‘This dot wasn't Louis Vuitton level,' it'd be like, ‘What do you mean?' It's all an expressionist painting. By the way, you know we die. 80 years, 60 years, 50 years, you know we will die. But on that day, I lived.
LS: A question that came in from Natalie Wo, it goes back to what you said about your dad. Your dad was in the Black Panthers and your last collection did have a very political undertone. It was very much about racism.
KW: Wait a second, is that a white person who said that?
LS: I don't know her ethnicity
KW: I think it's racist when white people assume when a black person uses colour, it's a political statement.
LS: Were you not making a political statement?
KW: No! It's a painting. It's beautiful colours. That statement is not gonna stop the murders in Chicago. That statement is not gonna help people get jobs. That statement is not gonna take guns out of hands in Atlanta. That statement is not going to stop Zimmerman from bragging about… It's such a thing like I had this one stylist come up to me and Virgil was standing next to me and said, ‘You need to watch out for him. He's taking your place.' And I was like, ‘Oh, the one spot for the black guy at the dinner table in fashion? That place? Is that what you're talking about?' So the assumption that my artistic expression of clothing has something to do with race or politics - a more politically correct term ironically for racism - is racist in itself.
LS: A lot of fashion designers do see their work as political so maybe that's why people see your work as political or about social issues. Perhaps it's a compliment. They want to read something into your work because they think it has depth and it matters. It doesn't seem like you see it like that? Like McQueen's work for example, people saw it as political.
KW: Yeah, I'm not gonna let anyone score points on me. If someone asks me about something, I'm gonna block all shots and I'm not gonna take any free points. I'm not gonna have someone say, ‘Oh I heard you knocked that guy out two weeks ago while this happened,' and I would be like, ‘Oh yeah…' No. If it wasn't my intention for it to be political and everyone gives it this credit, and somehow they're giving it a credibility, I'm like well no… I don't even want that kind of credit. I don't want anything that I don't deserve. I just want a chance to drink at the clear fountain. I just want a clean shot. I just want a clean bat to swing, I want a clean bat to be able to swing at the ball with. Every one of these questions are gonna show the amount of dirt that's actually on the bat.
LS: Do you think it would be easier for you if you weren't famous then?
KW: Yeah, being famous is like the n-word. People remind me at every meeting about how famous I am. But somehow…. No, it wouldn't be easier. The answer is absolutely no. You need fame in order to sell your shit. That's why people pay for advertisers. So I'm basically the first of a celebrity that approached his entire career and life like he was an old bag brand that went and re-did itself and went and got a really cool designer that Anna Wintour suggested, to revitalise it and became a really big brand… Meaning like celebrities have always had a way that they were supposed to do business with licensing deals and this and this, but I always approach myself in a luxury way whether it's calling Nick Knight a million times to work with him or going to factories in Italy or begging Tessiclub which hasn't called me back yet to use their fabrics because they do Celine and Lanvin. I've always fought just to have better paints to work with. When I was in high school, I was at this national competition where I did a watercolour and the colour was really intense and I lost the competition because the judges were confused. They said either it's not really watercolour because the paint was too thick or I used watercolour in the wrong way. So I lost because of that. I don't know where those judges are today but…
LS: It wasn't the best feedback. You mentioned Anna Wintour and I wanna bring her up. She actually sent us a question for you. She said, what will you name your son and what do you hope for him as he gets older?
KW: I don't have a name for him, but what I hope for him is that he can feel purpose, that he can learn, that he has the opportunities. The other night, I was driving in Paris and I saw these three high school kids running at top speed. I don't know if they were chasing a guy or what. Once they got up to the street, there was a bus pulling off and they're beating on the side of the bus. Then I looked at the time and it was 1am so that might be the last bus of the night. And I was really saddened because I was like, ‘How can I make my son feel that?' Because once you've felt that, none of these fucking questions matter. When you've missed that last bus before, when you had the opportunity to get on the bus, you don't give a fuck about any of this.
LS: When have you felt that?
KW: When I've missed the last fucking bus! Going through the streets of Chicago and having to sleep downtown in a parking lot.
LS: Do you still get that feeling today about different things?
KW: No, it's almost like not feeling anything. It's almost like being numb because of what I went through. There's an employee that I'm about to hire that was the global manager of accessories at a really good company and she was really direct in the way she was talking. Then she went into this thing about how she stayed in a concentration camp till she was five years old and she didn't know that people actually took showers by themselves. After someone's been through something like that, they could give a fuck less about fuck. It's just like... be real. None of this facade.
LS: Do you care about the negative press coverage around you and your family? But also just the general coverage that your every move is scrutinised?
KW: Yeah. And that's the reason why, with the help of Anna Wintour and other people, we have actually made a lot of positive press coverage. The majority of the press we get is actually positive because the majority of the things that we do are actually positive. And even the negative can't outshine the truth. The truth shall come to light. You see it in front of you. You read this thing and they try to diminish me into some really simple concept and simple idea and every time someone has a conversation about this and that, they're like, ‘Wow, it's a possibility that he's thinking about more things and he wants to contribute more than I thought.' So, let me dig into what I think the gist is of what that person was asking. Do I worry about being in the public eye and raising kids? Yeah. Any situation you're in, you're going to worry about raising kids. But it's champagne problems too. There's people who can't feed their kids. That's something more to worry about. So I'm not going to sit here and complain about the so-called issues I have. These aren't real issues. There's people at war. There's people trying to make it to London right now. It's really fucking serious. You guys are talking to me about some celeb shit. That's not real shit. You know what? I'm alive. I'm breathing. I did a show. We sell it. I'm doing a second collection. I have no problems.
LS: Talking about the bigger things that do change who you are and completely affect your work. Carine Roitfeld, the stylist, she ask how has becoming a father changed the way you work?
KW: Well, the way it changed who I was... Three years ago, after this interview, I would have been on a train back to Paris to see the last of the shows and get that inspiration. And now, I'm on the first flight back home to see my greatest inspiration, that's my daughter.
LS: A lot of people have asked about your daughter. A particular one has to do with having a daughter and how it's changed the type of explicit lyrics you put into a song. And the way you talk about women in your songs. That question came from Ashley Geevers. She asked if having a daughter specifically affected the way you depict women in your music.
KW: Having a family period has completely made me rethink the way I rap. You know people extend their brand for a long time. There's true moments of genius and then there's just moments of looking through the archives and placing shit together. So many people rate ‘My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy' as one of the best albums. And ‘Yeezus' and ‘808s & Heartbreak' are so much better and stronger. ‘Dark Fantasy' is almost like an apology record. ‘Power' was the least progressive song that I ever had as a first single. It was like me going back and spending six dedicated months - it took over two years to release the album - but six dedicated months piecing together what people liked about me, to make an entire bouquet that they loved, that was the most listenable, that was the least challenging. People want to talk about how much they loved that like it was Thanksgiving dinner. And how long has Thanksgiving dinner been cooked for? And it's great, you don't want anybody changing things on Thanksgiving dinner. But you take ‘808s' or ‘Yeezus' where these albums got completely panned when they came out and then you see how they end up influencing things. So it's that balance of doing something that gives you a blanket of comfortability for the listeners and for yourself that you can go on tour and do this and walk around and everybody thinks it's so great and they're really happy that you did something they liked. And then you've got the times when you just have to give them what you see as your future. Give them your innovation.
LS: And having a family gives you more motivation to do that? To be more true to yourself?
skrrt skrrt
LS: That just comes from you?
KW: I just love my family.
LS: You talked about wanting to be given a shot and wanting to have your opportunity. Do you actually believe that one day you will be respected and regarded as one of the greatest of all time in fashion in exactly the same way you are in music?
KW: Of course. I'm Michelangelo. Of course. There's a time when I'm sure there were people sculpting better than Michelangelo, but he made David. So as far as that question goes, is there a time that you can go on the internet and find a shoe that people want more than my shoes? Well go fuck yourself then if it isn't and don't ask me no stupid shit like that again. With the love.
LS: Do you ever experience self-doubt?
skrrt skrrt
LS: Never?
skrrt skrrt
LS: Even when you were little?
skrrt skrrt
LS: Okay, good to know. One thing that came in from a lot of people: they picked up on that quote of your fashion being available to everybody. They want to know what that means and when it will happen because price point really relates to that.
KW: I'm not H&M, I don't have giant factories. How can I get the price point to what I need to be if I'm running an eight person design team... I'm saying it's going to take time to get there. This is what I'm saying when you don't have the right tools. This is the question that everybody has to ask. If you had the Celine design team and the Nike design studio and the Zara factory, could you do everything that you thought you could do? And what would everyone's answer be to that? Yes. But if you don't have the Celine outerwear person or the factory or you don't have the entire adidas studio and you don't have the marketing team or the sales team, you can only do what you can do. And we are doing a lot with what we have. What we have is the highest level of communication that has happened in the entire universe. My wife. She's like MTV and NBC and all this combined. Number one on Instagram. And then the entire family. And then you have me and my entire music family. Basically, there is no ad that you can put in any magazine that could somehow add up to any one of me or my friends or my family just walking on the street and getting photographed. That is the fucking reality of 2015 people!
LS: Does that make it easier to care less about critics? Because as you say, it doesn't really matter what they say. The percentage of people that would engage with that is a fraction of the percentage of people that would see one Instagram post from Kim.
KW: Yeah you know… I mean, what can I say about them? I appreciate everyone's opinion, but I refuse to have a lesser opinion about myself.
LS: What specifically do you think fashion is missing that you can bring?
KW: I'm not even concerned about bringing something to fashion. I'm just... I just want to be five years old. You know, when I was five years old I picked out my outfit for kindergarten. I would go to discount furrier, my mum would take me to discount furrier and I would keep grabbing furs and say, ‘What about this one mum? Or this one?' And they were always too expensive. The ones I liked when I was five. So I just want to be five years old. I loved clothes before I even knew a fuck about the fashion world. And I can't let the fashion world jade anything or try to give me a reason, or purpose, or a lack of purpose, or acceptance or a lack of acceptance to anything to just who I am when I was five. When my grandfather had a store in Oklahoma and he'd go to the flea market and hustle to get the best prices. He'd go and re-do people's furniture, he was a carpenter also. He took that store and he was able to raise a family in a time where the schools were still segregated and he named my mother Donda in 1949. He was predicting the future in 1949 and put himself in a situation where he was thirteen and his father put 50 cents in his hand and told him he was out of there. He raised himself in a situation to be able to put my mother into college to the point where she got a PhD and became the first black female chair of Chicago state University. And then had a son that she then named Kanye which meant the only one that would go on to combat every form of thought, of tradition, that the media have presented up to that point. So tell me about other people's opinions again?
LS: Is it your family who have had the biggest impact on your creativity, your sense of self and what you produce? Or were there other influences? It feels like all your creativity came from your sense of self, which obviously came from your family. Or am I wrong?
KW: I can't say where my creativity came from. I'm blessed to be talented. I would say that came from God. My ability to give a fuck about somebody's opinion came from my family. My ability to fight for my creativity came from my family. I'm sure people would just take that Michelangelo comment I said earlier and would take offense to that and think ‘Whoa, he still won't stop.' Let me just explain the justification of that. The proof of that. Ask any musician, period, of the past fifteen years - and I would be the closest thing to that. Those were be the sonic paintings. Fashion, clothes are sculptures, wearable art. Now, if you think about any brand, do you love every single thing from a brand? Look at the few opportunities I got to collaborate with Louis Vuitton, Nike, Adidas, really established companies and the level of love and impact people have for that product. That had proper infrastructure. So I had to take the money I made from being the motherfucking Michelangelo of music of the past fifteen years and invest it in trying to build an infrastructure against all odds, and basically building a sculpture studio. So I wanted to raise the branch up a little bit higher on that low-hanging fruit everyone was going to snatch at.
LS: Why run for president? You have proven to be more influential than a president and running for office would limit your ideas. Everything you could do and would want to do as president can be done now. Other great leaders, Gandhi, Mandala, never needed to be elected to make a change, so why do you feel the need? (Caden Roberts, 14)
KW: Mandela got elected.
LS: Yeah, he's fourteen, give him a break.
KW: Okay, I won't start cursing at him. Certain things that I'm compelled to do in life, I don't feel the need to find justification for.
LS: So you're definitely going to do it?
KW: Yeah.

Something I did Something I don't
I can't explain how to
I cant' speak for everybody but
It must be more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband is minimize
That's why a lot of girls claim they ain't into guys
Mess with other girls part time to improvise
I knew she wouldn't ride though I seen it in her eyes
And I'm like any other guy tryin' get in her thighs
She telling me 'bout how black people should enterprise
And I'm like if you don't get yo' ass in this ride to Enterprise
Said I rent it yesterday and got to have in by 5
With the gass fully filled up like I didn't drive
Told her had a girl dawg fuck it I didn't lie
Said this rap game is all right I'm just getting by
She had a little weed and we get a little hight
And I'm looking in her eyes and I'm loving the five
Told me back in 95 she fell in love with the tribe
Move back to 92 I was just like you
Please don't get confused by the ice and jewels
I'm like any other guy that buy ice to stay cool
Like any other nigga that claim they hate school
And think yeah Free's banging, but she no Racheal
(chours)
We ball till we fall
skrrt skrrt
After we hit don't call
Fill your lives
With nothing, but lies
And I would like to apoligize
(repeat twice)
You can't stand right here
And tell me everything is going to be all right
Cuz until the day a man starts to stand up I'm going have to improvise
I've been waiting my life, and I stayed on my grind
Now I made up my mind, it's been way too much time
That's why, it's just impossible, It's I'm-poss-ible
And you know that
(I don't wanna hear that bull shit, I wanna hear that official shit)
(Kanye and that Twista shit, that's so impossible to get it (it's just impossible))
(Get it, that's so impossible to get it)
Get it, that's so impossible to get it (It's impossible))
Ain't no way you could pull up to the party in a Bentley blowing be in a club like this (oh no)
Ain't no way you could cook up in the studio with Kanye and get it jukking in the club like this
Ain't no way that you could win, dust some haters off while I'm sipping on my 'hen,
Holla at a chick while she sippin on her gin
And I got the mobsters hollering at her friends, (its impossible)
For you to ever be the nicest; you ain't get gangsta or get righteous,
You ain't never stood on a tip like this, you ain't never stood for no shit like this
(Its just impossible)
For you to get it if you don't wanna win; so get up off ya ass
And go for yours
And never for mine
Now you ain't from the ride that I'm in
Know what I'm
Saying
It's impossible for you to ever get wit me because of how I ride on the track;
Got the bitch in the back of the billy yo? When my celeb
Used to have the bitch in the back of the Cadillac (it's just impossible)
Niggas always hating
Leaving me for wiling out for po kim
You be sitting back talking yo shit
It's not Jay-Z and Beyoncé
It's not Nicki or Lil Wayne
It's not Oprah and Obama
The Pope and Rihanna
Queen Elizabeth or Kanye
It's not pentagrams or witchcraft
It's not triangles or stacks of cash
Black magic or Gaga
Gucci or Prada
Riding on the Golden Calf

[Post-Chorus 1]
It's the enlightenment that started it all
The Founding Fathers wrote it down on the wall
And now the media's misleading us all
Turned right into wrong
It's time to dance and turn this dark into something
So let the fire burn, this music is bumping
We're gonna live forever, love never dies
It starts tonight
Behind the curtain of the New World Order
It's not platinum encrypted corners
It's not ISIS or the Phoenix
Pyramids of Egypt
Don't make it into something sordid
It's not Steve Jobs or Bill Gates
*3 Minute Pause* 
1985 white Lamborghini Countach, 2 of 'em 
I need a slow motion video right now 
Cause I'm moving in slow motion, slow motion 
Feeling like Hype Williams shooting a nigga 
Shooting a nigga, hey, hey, hey 
I need a slow motion video right now, ay, ay 
Damn baby pussy can't be your only hustle 
Unless you bad as Naomi Russell 
I mean a lot of niggas got money 
So basically, Russell ain't the only Russell 
Russell Brand, Russell Crowe 
Zero Zero Zero Zero, a whole lot of 0's 
What you after, actor money? 
You in line behind currency, yeah you after money 
Bullet proof condom when I'm in these hoes 
Got staples on my dick (why?) fuckin' centerfolds 
And I swear to God they so cold 
Got a nigga in Miami wearing winter clothes 
I got my fur on feelin' like Jerome 
She got her fur too, we got our his-and-her on 
Don't look at the jewelry, or get your blurr on 
Too close, you comatose so dope you overdose 
Get back, you overclose 
Oh no, the hood was strugglin' 
But then I blessed them with that Polo 
Niggas was making music and then my first solo... 
Collo Drolo sponsered by Manalo 
She got Zeppi Notos ready for some photos 
Yeah and I'm cold bitch, please try to keep the door closed

I'm acting like I got a white ass block
I am the danger, I am the one who knocks
This ain't no longer penny stock
I'm trying to join Rock-A-Fella
While smoking a panatela
Might rock a bit of Coachella
'Cause my girls look like fraxinella
Got so many whores, I should be on hoarders
Even when they got retarded eating disorders
Always catching me with these court orders
As, they loved carrying recorders
Lyrically I am the best talented
My competition line is unhabited
I'm the reason genius is patented
The scale seems quite unbalanced
I'm feelin' iconic and this shit ain't goin' away
The modern day da Vinci sent from fuckin' Spain
You can't stop the man, who's weapon is his brain
You can't hold him down even with the strongest chain

We're in a renaissance period. We're in a place where people are multi-disciplined artists. Like Steve McQueen who directed 12 Years a Slave. He was considered to just be a photographer, but then he won an Oscar. We're not in a place where people can only have one career or one profession throughout their entire life. So the exact amount of emotion and color palette and sonics and everything I put into my music, I put them into shoes and they worked.
‘Kanye's pissing everybody off.' They try to position that through the media in some way that I'm like, whatever. Whatever your friends might say. ‘I saw Kanye.' ‘How was he? Did he…?' I care about people. My dad lived in homeless shelters less than five years ago. To find out he's a psych major. My mom was the first black female chair of the English department at Chicago State University. I was raised to do something, to make a difference.
You know, I didn't take the Oscars as a joke. It was funny. It was like the moment. All black actors can talk about the glass ceilings that we've dealt with out in this town. And this is the moment. ‘You get your night. Go ahead. Chris Rock is going to do it. Bam. Talk about how many times you've been blocked from being able to excel.' I didn't take it as a joke. It ain't no joke, as Rakim said. It ain't no joke. ‘I used to let the mic smoke, now I slam it and make sure it's broke.' That's what I was raised on—Rakim, Phife Dawg, hip hop, expression. ‘Hip hop started out in the park…'

Damn your lips very soft
As I turn my Blackberry off
And I turn your bath water on
And you turn off your iPhone
Careless whispers, eye fuckin', bitin' ass
Neck, ears, hands, legs, eatin' ass
Your pussy's too good, I need to crash
Your titties, let 'em out, free at last
Thank God almighty, they free at last
We was up at the party but we was leavin' fast
Had to stop at 7-Eleven like I needed gas
I'm lyin', I needed condoms, don't look through the glass
Chasin' love, lot of bittersweet hours lost
Eatin' Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce
Tell your boss you need an extra hour off

That's right I'm in it (Should've known I would fall)
I'm in it (Stepping on tacks on the floor)
That's right (And boys at your door)
That's right I'm in it (Well you need to fight for your own)
Well the song says no one man should have all that power right?
There's definitively been times I let
Let power, get the best of me…
And let the world take the rest of me
I look in the mirror and say
“God, is this, is this my destiny?
Is this what I've done
After all the years of you blessin' me?”
Well maybe this is just a moment
A moment of you all testin' me
To see if I can still act professionally
To keep me at bay
Like the Chesapeake
Guess it's me
Just a ‘G
From the C.I.,
Honest… And why?
Why would you give me that Power? 
Knowing I was just an artist 
Knowing exactly where my heart is 
And I will only work the hardest 
And sometimes, put art, before being the smartest 
And sometimes act retarded 
Just look at what I started 
And they wanted me to be dearly departed 
Die, nigga die, and I had no reply 
And I still looked her in the eyes 
And said that I could touch the sky 
And after all the drama 
I wonder where I would be if I still 
Had my Momma, Common 
And everybody I was promising around me 
You know how niggas from Chi town be, sometimes we wild 
Act like a child 
Get fouled 
Stay in style 
As of now …? 
... flows through the veins of a modern day 
Pharaoh. In American Apparel 
Standing down the barrel of the media 
For the man that face never made it in the encyclopedia 
His story, His glory 
…and they re-write history right in front of us - in front of us 
But what happens? 
When one of us is on the other side of that T.V. screen? 
You know what I'm sayin'. Real niggas you know what I mean 
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Or at least that's what I thought 
But when they sayin' “Hey that's what the real nigga do, right?” 
Some glad morning when this life is over,
skrrt skrrt
To a home on God's celestial shore,
skrrt skrrt
I'll fly away, O Glory,
skrrt skrrt
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye,
skrrt skrrt
When the shadows of this life have flown,
skrrt skrrt
Like a bird thrown, driven by the storm,
skrrt skrrt
Little girl, please stop your running
'Cause I'll erase away your pain
You're the only girl in town
Who always get pushed around
So girl, don't change (don't change)
Don't let yourself go, girl
Don't change (don't change)
'Cause I love you just the way you are
So little girl, please stop your running
'Cause I'll erase away whoooo your pain
(I'll erase away ) your pain
(I'll erase away )
Have you ever wondered where'd it all really went?
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Wondered if life had never been that it seems?
Wondered if life is all about the high beams?
The flashin' light, tryin' to get your money right
And you be up all night, tryin' to stay fresh today
Fresh like Mr. West and I'm proudly the best
I been sold on to that guest
Uh, the number one on the charts
Why is that? Because I rap from the heart
What I always did from the start
How I always played my part
Uh, they thought I was so crazy, I got a deal with Jay Z
Now they got to pay me and they looked up lately
I sold a million the first week
'Member when I just sold my first beat
Shit can change and it never stayed the same
Ma, I wonder, I wonder what it would be now
What it would be now, you all standin' in the crowd
Ten thousand, now they hate everythin' now
Everythin' now

Get to fuckin' on the dresser just to make that pussy wetter
Gotta put you in that vintage then you rockin' Perry Ellis
Then I leave with you, only cause I believe in you
We get to bangin' on the walls just to piss the neighbors off
You and them twelve foot ceilings, I just painted the halls
So I can breathe with you
I want to live my dream with you
You say that money don't matter it's the times and the memories
And now that ass gettin' fatter and I know it's because of me
I know it's because of me
I know it's because of me, got you in custody
Whoever knockin' at the door, they gotta wait 'til we finished
I know I started at the bottom but that ain't where we endin'

Here boy!
I'm so serious!

One, two them boys coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, hide your bitch
(Ayo Yeezy, pop your shit)
They said, thou shall not be ill, thou shall not feel
Thou should not be trill, not be drill, not be real
Niggas selling packs, niggas flipping pills
They got heroin and cracks, man these niggas hot for real
Every year gon be our year, every year gon be my year
These niggas really is out here, these niggas really is out here
The block is at war, post traumatic stress
Ran up outta pills, rob that CVS
Niggas getting bust over In God We Trust
We believe in God but do God believe in us
If we believe enough, will we ever get to know ‘im
That lean got us dozing, we forget that we the chosen

Aim at your brain, AK be the fucking letters

In Twilight, this guy I know
The palest skin you ever saw
All the girls still want him though
And now you know, I wanna be like Edward Cullen
I wanna be Edward Cullen
Wish I could be Edward Cullen
Wish I could be Cul-len
Wish that I could get all the girls, yo
Didnt have to breathe, didnt have to eat food
And of course I want to read everybodys thoughts
I wanna sparkle in the light, and drive a Volvo
And honestly I wanna play the Piano
Although it would suck to never turn 18
Cause I know pedophiles will try to rape me
I wanna say that Dracula is my homie
Be a Vegetarian even though I eat meat
Wanna say that Carlisle is my daddy
Thats such an awesome name, theyll all be jealous of me
Wish I could be in, Dr. Cullens
Family and the Olympic Coven
Then Edward can, be my brethren
And he can tell me how to be more like him

K. West! Kweli!
Got searched on the plane, Arabic first name
Disturbed by the fame just like Kurt Cobain
Breath of life, kiss of death, my lips pursed the same
You flirt 'til she came
Nothin' hurt like the pain and torture
Daughters of the dust lookin' for a vein
Something to take in vain like the Lord's name
Put your hands together, got 'em all sayin'

Yo, it's all ghetto in gear higher than falsetto
More metal for beef that we don't let the law settle
I try to navigate the treacherous waters of
America's ghettos that set up to slaughter us
But there's more of us
Although we speak in different languages
We all pretty familiar with what anger is
Young and dangerous, trigger stranglers
Get up on some gangsta shit
Guns to bang ya wit'
And we put it on records to entertain ya wit'
Our growing pains go way deeper than Mike Seaver's
Our uniforms is white sneakers and white T-shirts
On top of wife beaters
We like to light reefers
The 'hood need us for rappers, just ain't the right leaders
I put a lot into it
This is my product and I gotta move it
Stop the industry but you can't stop the music
[Interlude: Mary J. Blige]
An upside down kingdom where life is just not fair (upside down kingdom)
Some many sufferin' cuz deep inside they're scared (so scared)
Fear pumped into their veins to keep them from their destiny
Where would they be if you and I don't care?
skrrt skrrt
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen
You're so privileged right now to be in the presence of
The truth (The days)
The creator (I praise)
The originator of this style (It's a shame)
Accept no immitations
Kanye To-The (The days)

In the club looking like a fucking chaperone
I'm in the club, posted up, ""Guess Who's Back"" is on
If not that then the Just Blaze track is on
It's all Roc the world, we all got your girl
Caught your girl, never gave back your girl
Watch the rap unfurl, after Beanie Mack confirm
Kanye best producer-rapper in the world
Now I have beans, I'm going after MCs
Show 'em that this rap game made for me
Made for us, they bite and they plagiar-us
They spit the style for the niggas that made it up
That's like me buying soul beats for my album
Dog, I had to eat, I sold beats from my album
Now I got heat, I hold beats for my album
February 18th, reach for my album
Niggas forcing me to keep the heat up
Black strap, white handle, I got Jungle Fever
Black Benz, white truck, and one 2-seater
I'm in the game getting change like a parking meter
And since Takeover
It feel like the whole hood try to get a Jimmy Jones makeover
I got the hood on my shoulder, city on my back

Verse 2:
I got a.. way with words, I use words in ways
I convince birds to come out they cage and play
Polly want a Gucci parka, ma what did you say?
Polly might get a cracker ain't no trickin today (hey)
But anyway though, she got it on smash like mashed potatoes
Yo Jin! We good wit this one, yeah
Good looking Kanye, Ruff Ryder, Roc-A-Fella collabo
You see, we're the next generation in this rap game
So it's only right we got down like this
[Refrain x2: Kanye West]
I got a love that's better than - you ever was
You've never been - no good for me
I guess I was - just way too hood for you to be with

While you're fast asleep
Do you experience nervousness or shakiness inside, faintness and dizziness? The idea that someone else can control your thoughts. Feeling others are to blame for most of your thoughts. Trouble remembering things, feeling easily annoyed and irritated. Feeling afraid in open spaces or in public. Thoughts of ending your life. Feeling that most people could not be trusted. Poor appetite, heart or chest pains?
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I feel like this all the time
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I feel like that all the time
Do you feel tempered outbursts, that you cannot control? Feeling lonely, even when you are with people, feeling blocked. Feeling blue, sad, feeling disinterested in things, feeling fearful. Are your feelings easily hurt? Feeling that people are unfriendly, or do you feel like people dislike you?

I don't want to be like what everyone else be like

If I gotta be like, what everyone else gotta be like

I see you callin', I be makin' it quick
I'ma answer that shit, like, ""I don't fuck with you.""
Bitch, I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go
I mean, for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill
Yeah, and everyday I wake up celebratin' shit
Why? ‘Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch
I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here
That's what made me this
And everything that I do is my first name (B-I-G)
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories; that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me she ain't got no clothes on
And then another one text, then your ass next
And I'ma text your ass back, like…

Limited amount of time, chasin' these dollar signs
And you ain't on your grind

Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten

There's this girl I know, so deep in love
Do almost anything to make him see she's the one
But he doesn't feel a girl like her, he's so so wrapped up
Cuz the average girl will give him anything that he wants
He's so caught up (He's so caught up)
He won't call her, he shows no love
So she decides
I changed my mind, Ooh
(I don't love you) I don't love you
(I don't love you no more)
No no no no no
Don't waste my time (Don't waste my time)
(I don't love you)
(I don't love you no more) No no
(Bring it back, bring it back, baby)
It's the funniest thing cuz I
Know how I feel inside
But you never felt the same as I
Never, never, never ooh, yeah, miss him so much
I betcha he don't even notice
He don't even realize, cuz he's
He's so caught up (So caught up)

Wake up, new day, same shit
Get dressed, gotta pay my rent
Little off for the money I spent
Next week 'til I get my check
And I don't even wanna work at this job
Matter fact I've been workin' too hard
Let's say I quit today
Come back, go postal tomorr'
This time I'ma take shit too far
I don't give a fuck who you are
When you broke they do you so wrong
When you blow they knew you was raw
Two strikes so you can't sell coke
Two kids so we can't stay broke
But the street life all we know
So you know one thing? I can't say no

If it wasn't for the fact that I so happened to be rappin'

Since the tight jeans they never liked you
Pink-ass polos with a fucking backpack
But everybody know you brought real rap back
Nobody had swag, man, we the Rat Pack
No matter how many times that you told me you wanted to leave
No matter how many breaths that you took, you still couldn't breathe
No matter how many nights that you lied wide awake to the sound of the poison rain
Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?
(Heart beat, a heart beat, I need a heart beat, a heart beat)
Tell me would you kill to save a life?
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn let it all burn
This hurricane is chasing us all underground
No matter how many deaths that I die, I will never forget
No matter how many lives I live, I will never regret
There's a fire inside this heart and a riot about to explode into flames
Where is your God? Where is your God? Where is your God? ...

I'm just tryna find my way out this fucking kitchen
A birdseye view got me channelling my vision
Turn one to two now the kilo's got a sibling
Father knows best, wash my hands all is forgiven
We kicking up dust like the colosseum floors
Walls full of safes like they mausoleum doors
Pussy getting wet as she walking through my morgue
Grants, Jacksons no room for George
Yeh, the Fear of God's in you muthafuckers
This art imitate my life
You WorldStarHipHop fame based off imitation hype
Eliminate the fools gold and imitation ice
My music for your soul, inspiration for your life
Every dime made in his life more disastrous
Help my young bitch see her way through her Bachelor's
Sent my old bitch right back to get her Masters
Same graduation I was clapping in the rafters
The truth hurts everytime it's revealed
What goes around comes around, this is lifes ferris wheel
Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel as I parrallel park
skrrt skrrt
The fact that I'm free lets me know God is great
Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate
These rappers talk crowns but I'd rather talk fear
Villian like candyman, say my name and I'll appear
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Hakuna matata, feet up sipping java
Strolling up the totem poll, what's my only problem
Scrolling through my Rolodex, who shall bear my toddler
So many hands raised as the band plays
I'm here now, watch how many nigga's plans change
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
And at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it's random
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
And a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative
And sold your dreams, you don't know who did it
I treat the cash, the way the government treats aids
I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it
skrrt skrrt
Hot American Apparal girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
Told to take them glasses off and get in the pool
It's been a while since I watched the tube
Its like a crip said: “I got way too many blues for any more bad news”
skrrt skrrt
They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday
What's a black beetle anyway, a fucking roach
I guess thats why they got me sitting in fucking coach

Verse 1 [Kanye West]
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
She said, excuse me little homie, I know you don't know me- but
My name is Wendy and, I like to blow trees and
skrrt skrrt
They can come from outta town I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow em off
And make em straighten up their act, cause she know they soft
skrrt skrrt
And at nighttime her face lit up so astounding
And I told her in my heart is where she always be
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Knew I was gang affiliated got on TV and told on me
I guess it's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, Ye keep making that, keep making that platinum and gold for me
skrrt skrrt

She said ""Excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
And make 'em straighten up their hat cause she know they soft
skrrt skrrt
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
skrrt skrrt
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
skrrt skrrt
She said ""'Ye, keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me!""
skrrt skrrt

skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Maybe we can start again
A junkie walking through the twilight
skrrt skrrt
I left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone
Home is where the hatred is
Home is filled with pain and it
Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again
Stand as far away from me as you can and ask me why
Hang on to your rosary beads
Close your eyes to watch me die
You keep saying, kick it, quit it, kick it, quit it
God, but did you ever try
To turn your sick soul inside out
So that the world, so that the world
Can watch you die
Go ahead roll it up and pass it round
Cause lately's been a whole lot of bullshit going down
A lot of soldiers ain't make it through this year
So lets just celebrate that we still here and
Whoooooooaa
Never leave me alooooooooone
skrrt skrrt
I'll be comin home
Ooh, never leave me alooooooooone
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
My homie called me like what up man
Not from Florida but what up fam
It's been a whole lot of hatin' again
And if they hatin' on me damn what up then
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
She said ""Excuse me little homey, I know you don't know me

Can't see you niggas anyway, too busy standing on my pride, ah
Yeah yeah, got a lot lotta shit to say, so I'mma start off saying this
I can give a fuck what a magazine say, get off my dick, hm
skrrt skrrt
I see your pockets getting chubby, get a loan from me
Don't leave your bitch alone in the room with me
Tying rope or comatose her in a coma, homie
Little little homie bigger than your biggest homie
Rich Homie Quan told me just get richer homie
So I'mma keep making millions independent homie
The money greener than the reefer Wiz Khalifa showed me
I'm up in London smoking skunky with some (real niggas only)
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Can't see you niggas anyway, two bitches standing on my pride
I, yeah yeah, got a lot of shit, shit to say, so I'ma start of saying this
I could give a fuck what a magazine say, get off my dick
skrrt skrrt
I don't fuck with no broke bitches
I don't fuck with Hollywood niggas
I don't fuck with no gold diggers
Only fuck if she dope, nigga
I can give you everything that you want
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
You can't buy this at no luxury store
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
[Pre-Chorus 1: Madonna]
There's a place you gotta go
Before I let you take it all
It's like a drug, it should be illegal
Baby, you should get down low
And drink my precious alcohol
You look so thirsty, I think you need it
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt

Clothes tight, clothes tight, holds tight, hold tight
skrrt skrrt

skrrt skrrt

And I just figured out the whole time
Uh, I was acting like I'm white
When I came up, had to show my ass, yeah, that's the black side
I was trapping out the bando, nosy ass neighbors uptight
When I come around, when I come around, niggas don't act right
I'm yelling out, “Please don't come with that fake shit,” screaming it all night
What the fuck did you say? What the fuck did you say? “ayy, uh”
I'm on my Wraith shit, I'm on my, I'm on my Wraith shit “race, yep, woo”
Get the fuck out my face, get out of my way “move, fuck did you say?”
I'm on my Wraith shit, I fell in love with all races “race, yep”

I be acting like I'm white “white”
Fucking white bitches, black and white dick “oh, ayy”
(?) like we don't tiki talk shit, bossed up
100 bump, I do that shit all night
Sniff a line
I be sniffing Miley Cyrus with Miley Cyrus
In a bathroom with my thumb in her ass
Now I'm acting like I'm white
[Pre-Hook/Chorus – Kanye West & Quavo]
You stayed 3 exes up and you never came to see me in my own room
You the only good enough for the mountain
Only good as the people you got around you
This is all associations around you
I only got (?) but never doubt you

Lets jet out the club, get some oxygen
Your friends claim I'm a player, you be lucky to keep me
But you know people gon' be talking 'bout us weekly
My car be in a Robb Re-p-o-r-t but what's more important to me
Is that you..
(Dwele) 
Open your ears 
Don't allow these words to be ignored by years 
Fearing lullibies, containing the same old lies (same old lies) 
Dealing just to deal is just a crime 
Besides I know you wouldn't mind 
Trying something new so.. 
(CHORUS) 
Let's (Let's)Try (Try) 
We can work it out 
If you let love(love) guide (guide) 
The way that you feel for me 
Oh(Oh) Why(Why)

You should hold on 
Please don't resist (don't resist)

I sold more dope than I sold records
You niggas sold records, never sold dope
So I ain't hearing none of that street shit
Cause in my mind, you mothafuckas sold soap
Got rich selling hope to the hopeless
But I'm a thinker, methodic in my motives
I motivate to put my niggas into motors
No woman, no child, no witness, no Jehovahs
Like Scarface but it's God's face in that mirror
We was made in his image, dialing and it's much clearer
Scoring from the heights but I wanted mine purer
Aryan, blonde hair, blue-eyed like the Führer
The judge and the jury, the jewellery mad froze
Water colors on my neck, fuck rhyming when you blinding niggas
We ain't the same color clarity of diamond, nigga
Nah, I ain't got nothing in common with yous
Pain in my heart, it's as black as my skin
They tipping the scale for these crackers to win
No reading, no writing, made us savage of men
They praying for jail but I mastered the pen
Descended from kings, we at it again
Just hand me the crown, I'm active again
Everything that it seems, hear my passion again
Was never my dream, the immaculate win
I was pissing my shorts having rich nigga thoughts
Wish I had a pistol before all the friends I done fought
Over night I seen a nigga go get a Carrera

Bitch I'm back out my coma, waking up on your sofa
When I park my Range Rover, slightly scratch your Corolla
Okay, I smashed your Corolla, I'm hanging on a hangover
Five years we been over, ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own ya, one more fuck and I can own ya
One cold night in October, pussy had me floating
Feel like Deepak Chopra, pussy had me dead
Verse One [Mashonda]:
Every time you were around me baby
Boy you know you drive me crazy
And I really wanna be your lady
That's all baby, nothin' else
I been watchin' you for a few years
Every time you come around, I just stare
There is somethin' I gotta make clear
All I want you to do is
skrrt skrrt
Hold me, hold me (hold me)
Show me that you do (that you do)
Wanna get to know me too
Hold me, no more lonely
I'm with you (I'm with you baby)
Verse Two:
We been spendin' more time together
Gettin to know each other better
Baby I am down for whatever
Slowly fallin love
Cause you treated me like a princess
Wit you, don't have to worry 'bout stress
And I really have to confess
You're the best baby
skrrt skrrt
Verse Two [Kanye West]:
See none of the girls know me, but they all want me
So when they start runnin' they mouths just hold me
And keep me in your
Prayers so these naysayers

What this man can't handle is me
Dark and lonely now

Who's that too bad chick on his crown?
I meant mine, but I hit jaws when I'm around
So, in this talk, (get off the ground)
Anyway, 5-foot and an even digit
She told me her identity, I didn't even get it
She reminded me like (fool)
Kindly, she amused me
Like, fine, she's not a groupie
I'm not wack, though
She know the game's rules
But I don't claim jewels
I just be (lookin' like) cool
Niggas (lookin' like) fools
Meanwhile, I be lookin' bright
All the haters stay (lookin') tight
And she be lookin' like a Smurf, cool
Sonic and Smurfette, way too much blue
Stay cuttin' school
Took her on a date, yeah, we cruise
Barnes and Noble, wait for the news
She said she was datin' some dude
It must be because I gave her a break from the tool
Now that all the smoke is gone (lighter)
And the battle's finally won (give me a lighter)
Victory's finally ours (Lighters up, lighters up)
History so loved, so long, so long, so long…
In search of victory, she keeps eluding me
If only we could be together momentarily
We could make love, and make history
Why won't you visit me, until she visits me
I'll be stuck with her sister, her name is defeat
She gives me agony, so much agony
She brings me so much pain, so much misery
Like missing your last shot and falling to your knees
As the crowd screams, for the other team
I've practiced so hard for this moment victory don't leave
I know what this means, I'm stuck in this routine
Whole new different day, but the same old things
All I got is dreams, but nobody else could see
Nobody else believes, nobody else but me
Where are you victory? I need you desperately
Not just for the moment, to make history
So now I'm flirting with death
Hustling like a G, while victory wasn't watching
Took chances repeatedly
As a teenage boy, before acne
Before I got proactive, I couldn't face she
I just threw on my hoodie and headed to the streets
I swear I met success, we lived together shortly
But he wasn't talkin' bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word...
And he explained the story about how Blacks came from glory

And I done been on hold for some years, it's getting old
I'm too blessed to fit the mold, they said press six to give your soul
Or not and you can hold, you ain't never gonna explode
Or expand across the globe, but look like I just skipped the cold
Hello all up in your ear, you should hear me loud and clear
We was not allowed in here, and now we smoking loud in here
How we in the game and they ain't put a chain on them
Cleaning in that thing and my Sprite don't got a stain on it
Lil Xan fuck the Chance up, Donnie Trumpet said bands up
Donnie McClurkin said stand up
I know contracts are like handcuffs
I know combat when it's hand to hand or with handguns
I know answers, I know man to man, can't stand us
I know exactly how you wanna brand us
I take campers to the campus fix the trips and get the bus
Fast like Twista mixed with Bust
When Windy lost boys I had pixie dust for a pick me up
Spit shine 'til it's crystal clean like Listerine from a Dixie cup
Mama Jann band-aid kiss the cut
Now I'm thinking about offices and mansions with amenities
And runneth over pools and infinities
I think I just fell in love with a porn star
Turn the camera on, she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners, do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache
Make her knees shake, make a priest faint
Make a nun cum, make her cremate
Move downtown, cop a sweet space
Livin’ life like we won the sweepstakes, what!
We headin’ to hell for heaven’s sake
Well I’m-a levitate, make the devil wait, yeah!
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby we’ll live a hell of a life
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams in your wildest
You could hear the loudest screams
Comin’ from inside the screen, you a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal, or do a gangbang
It’s kinda crazy that’s all considered the same thing

Heavy Hitter for life 
Heavy hitters for life 
You rappers think I give a f*ck about the way the day spent 
Want to be on my album but don't want me on they sh*t 
Everybody thought i was makin a compelation 
I was really makin myself they competation. 
Fresh off the plane form the all star game. 
Bone girls on t.v so it's all star trains 
Just picture man. No stichin man. 
somethin for the phiends fresh out the kitchen man. 
Last 9/11 I was poor on a half till I floored up my math 
Now it's Porsche 9/11 and I'm floorin the gas 
Problems that i had no more. 
well damn look at how everybody den changed 
all my niggas is bout to have it made 
I woke up this morning with peaceful visions of you
Although I know you're gone
Your spirit's here with me
For our love was such an event
I know that it had to be heaven sent
Yeeah
There's gonna be some shit you might not understand
But, you may have to rewind this shit a few times
Heaven, heaven
skrrt skrrt
I know tomorrow ain't a promise
That's why I live one day at a time
So when it's my turn, there'll be no crying
I'm aware that when my number's called I'm punching the clock
No need for screaming at me momma, I'm out
And plus I wasn't really happy here to start with, let that be told
My own homeboy was robbing me, and that's 3 cold
I said '3', It's all intentional, cause 2 don't count
When your own blood is bitter and your homeboys bounce
Who the fuck is you gonna trust when your road dog is scheming?
And every other corner, you're passing a different demon
And now the clouds is open, I'm remembering this
Your families your backbone, your friends ain't shit
Now I believe it when Rhonda was saying ""Back in the days...""
When our homeboys left, she the only ones stayed
For that very reason, I'm a try and give her the world
Found heaven in the form of a girl, everybody's saying
skrrt skrrt
My angel
My sunshine
skrrt skrrt
My best friend
My good time
skrrt skrrt
Listen to different scriptures, they teach on God
And if you ain't never met him, don't speak on God
I'm serious about religion, this shit's ain't no song
I'm hearing niggas makin' up scriptures, and playing along
skrrt skrrt

You need to watch the way you talking to me you know
I mean after all the things that we been through
skrrt skrrt
And yo I know of some things that you ain't told me
And yo I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back
And you gon' show me

You're bringing out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't gonna speak so why we up 3 a.m. on the phone
Why does she be so mad at me for, homie I don't know she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up cause I already know how this thing goes,
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
skrrt skrrt
You wait a couple months then you gon' see,
You'll never find nobody better than me
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt

skrrt skrrt

And you just gon' keep hatin' me

skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Life is like a long love song so I vibe
Yellow brick road on 24's as I ride
Shorty is a winner, when I'm in her I get lost
Make her tremble like the middle of December on the frost
UGG boots in a coupe dual exhaust
As I fall deep in love, Mr. West check my pulse
Paintings on the wall, Basquiat is her favorite
Black Maybach way trilla than a slave ship
How can I not spazz, questions that I'm asked
Home owner at nineteen, yo I done learned fast
My first love cheated on me, she was heartless
She fucked the quarterback and seperated partners
I took my quarter back and played another cartridge
I took my locket back and threw it in the garbage
I sang a melody, it sounded nice as T-Pain's
Okay I'm playing follow me, just to peep game
We party hard and fall asleep on the airplane
If she flirty in the dirty, then she fair game
Checkerboard luggage as they holler all aboard!
Portishead in the iPod until I reach a snore
In the clouds of the lear, thinking of Shakir
Run the game like my nigga still was here
In the clouds of the lear thinking of Shakir
Heartless
How could you be so?
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt

I decided we weren't gonna speak, so
Why we up 3 AM on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me for?
Homie, I don't know she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me
skrrt skrrt
You wait a couple of months, then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody, never find nobody better than me
skrrt skrrt

And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight into the night
How could you be so heartless? [4x]
How could you be so? [x2] 
In the night I hear them talk 
The coldest story ever told 
Somewhere far along this road 
He lost his soul 
To a woman so, a woman so… 
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
To take my mind out of this hell
Or my heart out of this jail
There are no clothes that I could buy
skrrt skrrt

Don't wanna have to cock back the four pound boy
Look scrapper I got nephews to look after

Jigga held you down 6 summers; damn, where's the love?

Everytime I sit down I can't put it into words
From the day you give me birth, day you say them baby birds
Day when I was praying, poppa' laying in the dirt
I been the worst, and I know I know, I know I know but my mothers been my saving grace, gave me space to grow
And they say it glows, when I be spraying out my flows, looking out into the rows and see my mother at my shows
Only one of those, uh, so one high is worth a hundred lows
And some of those, there's been a ton of those
We stick together through whatever, never run involved
Cause roof down, running bros as the summer blows, ch'yeah
Only my mother knows, only my mother knows
Uh, and I heard 'em say, nothings ever promised, tommorow today
Uh, but I heard 'em say, uh
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
Uh, But we'll a find a way
And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way
Uh, so I say I'm sorry for the swearing
Ch'yeah I know it gets a little overbearing
It's just the way you laugh, and I start to say I'm fast

Bitch outta line -
Ho been drove me outta my mind
She like, I shoulda knew before I lay down and slept with him (slept with him)
Now she wish that she could sleep with him (sleep with him)
Take a stroll with him
Wanna creep with him (with him)
Roll with him (with him)
And turn to a freak on him
Ain't have no patience with him when the ceilin leaked on him
Creeped on him
But I'm a boss baby you crossed the line
No orders go rock to hit all your girls
From the bed to the tub, bathtub to the ceilin
Killin' the world... holla!!
When you hear the song
Will you cry(make you won't cry, don't it)
Cause you know you wrong (it's all good baby, don't even worry about it)

He was never known for shootin' the toola packin' the chrome
He was known for shootin' the hoops up
Little hustle nigga grind (grind)
To get his jeans and boots up
At the summer league game D game rough
And the summer heat had ya'll niggas feelin' like ya'll so damn tough
Wrong words, couple of shoves, park full of hoes
Had his hands all in your mug
How could you roll with pride in your way
You drove with your .38 to the place where he stay
Said, ""say hi to the pearly gates and scrolls.""
I always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, way down
One day, they'd tried to bring me down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down

Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
skrrt skrrt
'Cause when I was barely livin', that's what kept me alive
skrrt skrrt
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some leeway on the he say, she say
Your girl don't like me, how long has she been gay?
Spanish girls say ""Yo, no hablo inglés""
And everybody want to run to me for their single
Don't want nobody to die
Don't want to have to ride but in this game
I guess that's just the way, I guess that's just the way
Have it your way
It's gonna be slow singing, flower bringing
Gat clinging, bat swinging, bullets flyin', niggas dyin'
Mom's cryin, faggots really don't want it
Lead coming, blood gushin from ya arms, legs, head and stomach
I felt the hatred, cause when I turned around like the Matrix
Comin for me, an array of bullets headin dead for me
First the one, and then came the two and three and four
Five, six, seven, shots from a mac 11
Platinum producer killed by haters tonight on Channel 7
He do beats for 2Pac, now coming out the spring from Heaven
Ya know my piece is, hotter than grease is
With no wrong way to eat ya face like a Reese's
Seem like the second I get some shine
Niggas quit they fuckin' job so they can hate full time
So, gimme the gat, I hit em wit that
Cock back, blat blat
Let me tell you niggas something familiar
Broke niggas don't want war, man I'll kill ya
Oh oh, I get it, this year, niggas don't dance
Haters, haters; these niggas is haters
And I made myself so easy to love
How much they hate it? very!
Kiss girls like Katy Perry
I am never sprung, but I Spring 'er, Jerry
Don't try this at home: results may vary
King like T.I., but in the Chi, Larry...
Hoover, Hova
Both are American Gangsters
You choose who's colder
Rappers get nasty in the booth but I'm grosser
I can't even stomach myself, ulcer!
More realer cause I'm closer
Had girlies in girdles weighing more than they supposed to
Poser, no sir
My hustle, so Russell
I stretch work, yoga
You know I got it down, dog
Al Roker, I used to knock pounds off
It ain't nothing for me to knock some nouns off
At these MC's praying for my downfall
They just haters, I wave at you
I'm so player
I'll never be done, I'm so rare
We killing the game, it's not fair
skrrt skrrt
But I just wanted to tell you guys: I really do believe that the world can be saved through design, and everything needs to actually be “architected.” And this is the reason why even some of the first DONDA employees were architects that started designing t-shirts instead of buildings. But just to see the work actually be actualized
If I sit down and talk to Oprah for 2 hours, the conversation is about realization, self realization, and actually seeing your creativity happen in front of you. So the reason why I turn up so much in interviews is because I've tasted what it means to create and be able to impact, and affect in a positive way
She's not a girl, who misses much
(Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe)
Do do do do do doo, oh yes.
(The rock is still alive every time I rhyme)

skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame,
When he came, in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
Its Kanye - But some of my plastic - still say Kane
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
[Busta Rhymes]
Tell me, who you really really really think is more lyrical?
Cause everytime I go somebody got to see they medical
And everytime I come, I'm eating everything that's edible
And if you ain't already know, then who be more incredible?
They wanna call me crazy like I'm borderline clinical
Cause how I do it and I kill ‘em and I get incredible
And magically do it like this was another miracle
And if you don't like it you can suck up on my genitals
Ta-ta-ta-tal ta-ta-ta-ta tals
Do it little bitch and get up off your little pedestal
And whenever you see me, you better salute the general
Cause I will break it down to every single little mineral
(Slurp, slurp, slurp, slurp)
Suck up on my testicle again when you see me counting money
Move the decimal again
Bout to cop another diamond out of Senegal again
Everybody saying that he's uncomparable again - okay
(first of all, this song right here got...)
You say what is it that you want?
(...a long ass intro)
You got everything that a woman could ever need in life
(you got everything)
You got a closet full of minks, Chinchilla
(you got beats from Kanye)
I got a bureau full of diamonds
(what else ya need?)
I can change four times a day if I want to
You even tryin' to eat lobster and drink champagne
Now you know that ain't your roots
For you strictly a collard green and cornbread bit
Now you know if anybody know it I know
But since you feel like that this evening
Sit down (know what?) and drink some champagne with me
And let me rap to you
You'll never catch me in that baby momma Benz again
I'm pushin' a G5 
All the girls sayin' that his hair look Indian 
And ain't never seen him and MCM 
Now I don't like fake boobies but I'd do it to Lil'
Kim (yes I would) 
We gon' roll this weed 
We gon' play like Sonny Bono and hit these trees soon as we get alone 
I'm doin' these beats for pro bono soon as we get to bone 
Now she like a lotta clothes, I like to see her out of 'em 
She got a lot exposed, pump up the volume
Pump up the volume, dance, dance 
Don't give Kanye a chance 
Cuz I'm a Gemini with two sides and two rides 
Y'all talkin' business, I'm peepin' her thighs 
Look, I'm tryin' to hit that back end 'fore I get that back in
Let these niggas live, T
Bitch ass niggas don't know me
New sandwich with bologna
I ain't really y'all niggas friends, none of y'all mother fucks is my homie
I bought a brand new tree
Y'all niggas don't know me
A, B, C, 1, 2, 3, AK-47 hit a nigga in his teeth
He be talking lotta shit but ain't wanna be handlin' the mother fuckin' business that he need to
If a nigga got a problem I'mma hit a nigga in his fucking back when I see you
Fuji Water, Fuji Water, I'mma go and piss on my daughter
You don't believe me? I'mma maul her
Real nigga on the track, bitch
Come through with the sandwich
That's bread, lettuce, cheese, mustard, bread, crumble
You know the Buick got the suicides
Roll up on that Buick, nigga you gon' die
You'll never know who in-fucking-side
I come through, commit a fucking suicide
I got nine wives, nine lives, nine bags of chips, nine bitches, WE BOUT TO GO ON A FIELD TRIP
[Interlude: Earl]
You're so excited for that field trip, admit it. We about to go on a field trip! How stoked are for that field trip?
Sandwich, bread, lettuce, cheese, tomato, mustard, bread, crumble
Sandwich, lettuce, cheese, tomato, ketchup, mustard, who you tryna fuck wit?
Not me nigga cause I got the heat nigga
If you got a mother fucking problem, nigga I will lay the mother fucking shit down

(feat. Kid Cudi)
I need to call it off, I need to make it known
'Nother one, something gone, Capricorn
Dancing out on the lawn, fancy like the things she likes
She lives her life, I'm living mine
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Maybe it's cause she into Leos
And I was into trios, plus all the trips to Rio
Couldn't have helped, it's gettin' cold
Better bring your ski clothes, pick it through the keyhole
The door locked by myself and I'm feelin' it right now
Cause it's the time when my heart got shot down
Blocka-blocka, blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka
Pour a little champagne, cranberry vodka
Feelin' lied to like parents never said you adopted
Your feelings like Zulu, then nothing is a Shaka
I hit her with Jamaican dick, I'm the new Shabba
She lookin' for her daddy, call me Big Poppa
On to the next saga
Focus on the future and let the crew knock her
Star Wars fur, yeah I'm rockin' Chewbacca
The one Chief Rocka, number one Chief Rocka
Fuck what niggas talking 'bout boy I'm on my grind
Pursuit of happiness so money on my mind
People say duty calls and if it's on my line
I get a two minute warning bitch you on my time
Heard it through that vine
That I ain't kicked it and that minute they was missing me
Hold the trap, had to give ‘em raps for their misery
Every snap I smile, the bitches make a gift for me
I'm laughing out the bank on my way to the dispensary
Get my hair cut, my nigga Kenny do that shit for free
The amenities of living life like a fucking G
When will they understand that niggas can't fuck with me
And I don't need the throne just seat me in the lap of luxury
I'll be smoking grass till it's grass that I'm underneath
Chilling at the pad with a bad one for company
I make the haters mad with the cash I accompany
I know you think I'm spaz but this only what I've done for free
[Kweli talking]

Same as the legend was told
To my ears at 5 years old

You've got too much shit goin' on yeah

I just got my check
I'm bout to spend it all on me
I'm worth it, yup
Hold up, tell me what you see
Pull up, watch these motherfuckers freak

I need a jail house to free my dogs
I pay taxes, pay dues, pay bills my whole life
So I'mma throw money in the air, like I'm tryin' to pay the sky
Told myself man if I can't life like this, I'd rather die
I give it up to God, and he always replies
Control, your hoes, you let her talk to you crazy
You got baby mama drama, you ain't even got you a baby
You foogazie, boss up, boss up with your time dog
You ain't got time for no hoes, I ain't even got time for time off
Just think about it
Flashing Lights, Men In Black
Men In Black, memory gone
Alright, whatever, forget about the original
Charles Hamilton

(Yea Sounds)
Hey Kanye, thanks for the beat man
I had to download it, I only buy New York hip-hop on 9/11
CURTIS!
I've been the same since the day I was born
So it won't be long till the day I get on
Wouldn't you knoooww!
It's my time to gooo!
Feeling like a million bucks
Want me to dumb down for you idiots, tough
Hotter than a bowl of chili, it's Chuck
So just let it burn like Chili and Usher
I don't wanna have to really get tough
But niggas think they shit is hot, and really it sucks
And I ain't talking crazy, on that 50 Cent stuff
But y'all think it's talent, and really is luck
Me, I'm blessed God, give me his love
Me and him on the same team, it really gets nuts
I spit for four days, your bitch go both ways
Imma introduce her to my chick, we gon play
Not Ray Lavender, it's Charles Hamil-pink
My girl got your girlfriend prick, it's OK
Look y'all, I don't play football
But Imma kill them with the bitches like Vick and OJ
Lights keep flashing
Everybody asking, Is he gon make it with the rapping
I tell them it's my passion
So if it's meant to happen, nigga it will happen, that's it
Girls getting on their flashing shit
Thinking they can get me with their ass and tits
One happened to be my ex's best friend
But me being me, I went ahead and wrecked it
I'm reckless, headless, yes accept it
But she wanted to be the next to catch shit
Doesn't matter, you told me to get to stepping
You hate me too much to come and get your necklace
AJ Calloway: First of all I got to say you all look absolutely fantastic
Kim Kardashian West: Thank you
Kanye West: Thank you so much
AJ Calloway: Are you excited about tonight?
KW: Very very excited
AJ Calloway: Who do you wanna see inside with the performances? Whats going on?
KW: I like to see Madonna perform
KKW: Yeah

[Refrain: Kanye]
Oh it can't Be

But you niggas gon' get in 'til you get to Miami
GLC gon be stoned as Angie

It's a celebration bitches more bottles of cham-p-aign
In love with the same stripper that sprung T-Pain
And all this Louis Vuitton shit ain't cheap mayn
Dawg I can't keep saying G.O.O.D music the greatest latest
Stunting out the middle of nowhere like Vegas
From the Chi, the city of hella haters
Where we keep rising to the top like elevators
Hi haters I'm back off hiatus I feel just like you I mean even I hate us
Turn the radio down I mean every song
Yeezy got a vision that's clearer than Evian
Used to hit the radio them faggots ain't let me on
Until Khaled turned up the volume
Hit the club with it come on homie they wilding
Nas done told you come on homie we major
Really Doe told you hoes where we staying
G.O.O.D music up in this bitch now quit playing

Dawg it can't be
G.O.O.D. music the Grammy family
A little bit a stunting, flicking dawg it ain't deep
I'm only trying to spend what they claim you can't keep
Before you die so I make sure I stay on the Chi side
Like Lakeshore Drive
What in the fuck was that Kanye
I told you to do some shit for the kids
You can give me your muthafucking graduation ticket right now
You will not walk across that stage, you won't slide across that stage
A muthafucka can't pull you across that stage Kanye
Who told you see, I told you to do something up lifting
I'm trynna get you out here with these white people and this how you gone do me
You know what us a nigga
And I don't mean that in no nice way
Had little kids sing about the shit, the jokes on you
You throw your mutha hands in the air, and wave good-bye to everybody
Cause you getting the fuck out of this campus

I'd like to thank everybody who came out tonight to rock with me. You could have been anywhere in the world. You could have been anywhere in the world...
This is the part of the show where I start complaining about shit, justifying shit, but you know how it is. I'm just happy to be making music and happy to be able to perform this shit for you all. You know with this album, we didn't drop no single for radio; we ain't have no big NBA campaign or nothing like that, we ain't even got no cover. We just made some real music
Kanye to The, yeah, you heard the name
Cheques plus raps finna murder the game, uh
Can y'all get it? Fuck y'all
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
All these niggas believe
They breathe the same air that I breathe and bleed like I bleed
Only difference though, I fuck better hoes
Iceberg clothes, I got to pose
Every whip with the studio in a hospital
This nigga flow is very sick
Plus very rich hoes, very thick chain, very thick
Feel like I could fuck every bitch
Twenties at the bottom, carry the six
If I cop back, then shot him, I buried him six
You can't hate this nigga with the platinum braces
I rather need new teeth than a whole facelift
Plus your taste is rather tasteless
Test my aim and watch me ace this
You wack rap cats need a replacement
So I hit the basement, took it back to basics
Reach down to my Timbs, grab my laces
Got loops on niggas, y'all want a tight noose on niggas
If I ain't holler at you for (?), niggas
What the fuck I got to do, another truth for niggas?
See, it don't really matter what y'all prove to niggas
Y'all ain't satisfied 'til we shoot some niggas
So if somebody got to die, tell me who want it
That Chi-Town, South Side bullshit, we on it
Who you know twenty-five that rolls?
Fifteen carats on top of the white gold
Pull up in the drop, then froze
skrrt skrrt
Go on 'head, baby, you could pose
Gettin' naked at Go-Getter shows
Then she drop, then froze
skrrt skrrt
Man, bitch, I ain't finished with your ass
Heavy all night, spendin' cash at the ball
At the show and before we got back
[Produced By: Kanye West & The Neptunes]
Turn my headphones up, louder
'Ello, 'ello, 'ello, hello white America, assassinate my character
Money matrimony, yeah they tryna break the marriage up
Who gon' act phony, or who gone try to embarrass ya
I'mma need a day off, I think I'll call Ferris up
(Bueller had a Muller but I switched it for a Mille
Cause I’m richer and prior to this shit was moving free base)
Had a conference with the DJs, Puerto Rico three days
(Poli with the PDs now they got our shit on replay)
Sorry I’m in pajamas but I just got off the PJ
And last party we had, they shut down Prive
(Ain’t that where the Heat play? Niggas hate ballas these days) Yep!
Ain’t that like Lebron James? (Ain’t that just like D. Wade? Wait)
skrrt skrrt
Yo I come from a crack in the ground, a hole in the wall
And dog when the crack ain't around, the smokers'll brawl
Streets like a bullet in cancer, it'll swallow you up
Or eat you from the inside and hollow you up
And everyday like a test, you know life got rules
And its sorta like checkers and chess
I went to school and took the lessons punk
Know a pawn get kinged, a bishop get juiced
A rook get jumped
Faggot niggas took the easy route
They either coked out, smoked out, doped out
Niggas took the needle route
And I ain't tryin to take either route
I'm tryin to stop get weeded out
Really, tryin to weed it out
No the flipside we choosin your way
Like gettin fat from losin the weight
Or losing that from, usin the weight
I feel like I'm speeding and I'm 'bout to crash
No where to go and I'm gettin there fast
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Ooouu hooouu, I got nowhere to
skrrt skrrt
Ooouu hooouu, I got nowhere to ruuuuunnnnnnn
(man speaking, girl singing throughout)
We in the streets player get your mail
There's only two places to go, we either dead or in jail
What the...
skrrt skrrt
Ooouu hooouu, I got nowhere
skrrt skrrt
Eh yo I'm caught up in the system where the blind lead the blind
Niggas gossiping, it runs the city, they don't know who watching them 
When they coming to get me, so I hit the block and bend 
Do about 60, and I put my glocks to them, like plow plow plow 
I'm gonna to get on this TV and put shit down 
I aint finna let these lights skinned niggaz come back in style 
I'm finna turn to this class clown, should be crazy deep 
They told my momma I was bipolar had A.D.D. 
I told em, what-what I wanna do, I wanna be a baller 
The dream spoilers are for ya 
Hatin on you to they mans on the corners 
Old folks said he'd never make it off the corner 
They are the virus that corrupts the soul 
They are the cubic zirconia inside the 10 karat gold 
That get green on ya, when you get green on em 
You gotta wash ya hands of em, get clean on em 
Somebody told me success is the best revenge 
So they gon be fucked up when you do ya thing on em 
Now hold ya plaques high, like who woulda thought 
And tell em, ahem, thank you for your no support 
They are the dreamkillers, they the dreamkillers 
Who know a dream, they are the dream (killer Norman Bates) 
They the dreamkillers, they the dreamkillers, dream 
They are the dream (killer Norman Bates) 
Now how you gonna talk about the way I spend my money 
Everybody say it with me now, it's my money 
And they know they hatin, but what they don't know is 
They are my motivation, they are my inspiration 
Cos we the leaders, and they the followers 
And we the nut busters, and they the swallowers 
They are the rumours, they are the lies 
We are the shit dog, and they the flies 
How you gon tell me how to live my life 
Ain’t no question if I want it, I need it
skrrt skrrt
I’m on the edge, so why you playing? I’m saying
skrrt skrrt
Not for nothing I’ve forseen it, I dream it
skrrt skrrt
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
All of them fallin’ for the love of ballin’
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that it’s random
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
And a new fitted, and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won’t be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?
Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I’m in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn’t sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jump shot, running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the World’s game, this is my Olympics
We make â€˜em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest nigga, I must have missed it!
I'm not sure anymore, more
Who is knocking at my door, door
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt

Me and my grandparents on a field tried-ip

Yo Yo
Ayo my silent moments, loud as the crack of thunder
My hunger is like the crocodile that attacks the hunter
It ain't commercial or underground, its true cause I
skrrt skrrt
Call it skill, call it game, call it glow, call my name
Like the lord, all in vain, screaming like you all in pain
Treat it like a drug, all up in ya vein cause (wanna be good to you)
We make the squares dance, and get the do like dosey
Y'all niggas roll with pussycats like Josie
All spoiled rotten like ghetto groceries yo
I clutch the mic like ya grandma clutch her rosary yo
Swooping the industry, like a bird to prey
My stanzas has got stamina, ya verses lack vertebrae
I heard them say I was a conscious rapper
But I'm a monster when I hafta smack the shit out of a nonsense actor
Using my 'hands solo' and I don't need chewy
Over your head like Yarmulkes and Kufis yo
Fuck the screen gems y'all niggas act in B movies
Type of niggas proud to be groupies
Followers in the herd running over the cliff
I'm the ""Buffalo Soldier"", smoke ya like a dreadlock rasta
Blowing the spliff, loading a clip to spit high
Like you holding blow in a stolen whip, rolling the strip
Looking to hit cops, now that's a 4 alarm
Black queen falling on my arms, you could call it charm
Mater fact call it what you want, its up to you bro
skrrt skrrt

Chorus (1x)
How many niggas ever been in love'
How many niggas really think they thugs
And can't think without the drink and drugs
How many niggas can't get in with hats and sneakers on
Say 'fuck security' and get inside and keep them on
How many niggas think that gats make the weaker strong
Can't do for self and wanna snatch the plate you eating on
That don't take heart, slave nigga play ya part

'Cause they got more ass than the models
The good life, so keep it comin' with them bottles
Till she feel boozed like she bombed at Apollo
Or I make the life
I was very rich
Already
But if I think back to when I was making the College Dropout, thinking was this what I expected?
I mean, I didn't expect the losses and you expect everything to work out well
But I expected real life
And then I suffered the worst pains to help me to grow
So those experiences, I never ask to take them away from me
Because they're all in God's plan and help make me the man I am today
And help make me more of a soldier and a vessel
Because if I hadn't suffered those losses, I might be scared or too scared to fight the war on traditional thinking
Better than the life I lived
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmomma
Ain't the only girl callin me ""baby""
And if you feelin me now
Then put yo' hands up in the sky, let me hear you say
Heyy, heyy, like we always do at this time
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I, gotta go for mine, I gots to shine
skrrt skrrt
Imma get on the TV momma and I'mma
Yo, I'mma put shit down

Welcome to the good life, where homies who sell D

Man, they say the best things in life are free
The good life, [it feel like Atlanta

This is about, like...
As classic hip-hop as it gets for my era and shit
You know
I'm gonna do some real shit on this one
Take a little breather
It's a true story
I learned my lesson
I'm sorry
There must be more good women than men, percentage-wise
I steady run through my mind, but shorter than finish line
What they fail to realize is I'm not that kind of guy
So I try to feed them lies when I look them in their eyes
Compliment them on their size, tell them I'm on the rise
Working with Kanye, Lupe, and Do or Die
Then tell them it's cool to rise, so why don't you come inside?
Then tell her I love her while lovemaking, then cum inside
Then later she let me drive inside her G35
Trying to come clean by telling her dirty lies
And telling her that she the shit, baby, you're native flies
Took her to expensive restaurants and made her buy
And somehow I made it by, funny she never tried
To ask for that cash that I owed her since last July
Trusting me as if I was the guy I idolized
And gave me more hype than a champion title fight
I guess there's more good women than men, percentage-wise
A lot of men get women because, really, they're killing time
I guess that's why a lot of girls say they ain't into guys
And focus on their view full-time to improvise
skrrt skrrt
Party people in the place to be
You are now in the midst of a real MC
Throw your hands in the air if you real as me
Are you ready to go?
skrrt skrrt
I know the city getting ready
Such an easy morning, we on a ride
And I’m feeling smooth as the way the Benz drive
Turn the radio down if they playing that bullshit
They don’t want black people to think and drive
He think he live, he think he cold
He think I’m high, I’m in thinker mode
Eyes lowed, I let the sky hold the thoughts
The streets are like the high road that I go across
I mean, my whole team about to smash the streets
The Phillip Lim remind them that it’s Fashion Week
And the weather wasn’t barely hot
Did I mention that the sweater was a Jeremy Scott?
Did I mention G.O.O.D. Music, yeah, forever we hot
Motherfucker, are you ready or not?
skrrt skrrt
This goes out to the hardcore hip-hop
skrrt skrrt
This goes out to the all core hip-hop
skrrt skrrt
As Ye flips the piano
The mood swings like the change of a channel
He’s heating up like they wrapped him in flannel
That nigga Mikkey. Kanye. Y'all know
Man I was sick of them bill collectors callin' my crib
And the filthy ass roaches tryin' to crawl in my shit (all in a nigga's cereal)
Before I flip, nigga had to keep callin' them tricks
See I spit now, now these hoes all on my dick (oh you're a rapper?!)
Like ""Mikkey won't you take me out?""
Chick please, it takes more than a rat to get cheese
You can lick deez
I worked hard to get G's
You can strip tease
That's too freaky? Well bitch leave!
I'm a cheap nigga
Keep my money discreet nigga
Cause chickens keep talkin' in the streets nigga
So I keep itchy
With a clip that'll spit fifty
Make fifty million spittin' over beats nigga please nigga
I just got a good ass job
The pay is good but the work is too hard 
And I don't want to work anymore 
So I won't stop till I reach the top 
Now I just bought a brand new car 
GS4 but the notes is too high 
So I'm gonna hit the club and pull some hoes 
Before they re-possess my ride 
Nigga please 
You work for UPS 
I work for Mickey D's 
I plotted on stickin' niggas for at least fifty G's 
Run up in they crib for the safe and the keys
Y'all ain't safe around me 
We done made wild stacks 
Made it to Cadillacs 
And still get pulled over for ""drivin' while black"" 
While back bill collectors call
We ain't answer (""He ain't here"") 
Light company will have to come and blow out our candles 
Now you know I got's to take a plane to Jamaica 
skrrt skrrt
He, gone
skrrt skrrt
You sweat her, and I ain't talkin 'bout a Coogi

Meu Escombatente.......
Não existe mais palavras pra me descrever
O quanto eu te adoro por ti vou morrer
Adoro tudo de ti não a excepção
Se fosses filmes escombatente eu sò assistia essa sessão
Mas eu voltei porque a saudade que eu tinha me atormentou
Se lembras escombatentes no tempo me perguntou?
Se ires quer dizer que mais nunca tu vais voltar
Pois a resposta escombatente è que sempre eu vou voltar
Como eu não iria?
Depois de tudo que tu fizeste
Amigos e alegrias
Foste tudo que tu me deste
Contigo eu aprendi
E comigo tu aprendeste
Meu escomba tu escreveste
A minha història na avenida Romances e mistèrios
Tinha comèdia e ficção
Horrores e sci-fi
Ser ou não ser era a questão
Esquecer-te escombatente
Eu nunca farei não não
Pois tu me deste mais que vida
Me deste o teu coração
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Meu Escombatente (2 X)
Adoro vir aqui passear
Provide a new coffin
You don't seek murder like this this often
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Our father
Might as well make a new casket
I'm a bad M-a-r-c-y P-r-o-j-e-c-t
Ain't no other motherfucker in the rap game harder than me
I go hard and get it in like a porn star
Follow my moves you wanna make it to the top, I'm on star
For new born stars
Even when the camera stop
I'mma hundred million dollar movie handle my cock
Big homie from the back block
When you first learn how to slap box
Then you even learn how to dribble the pill
Or to hand the pot, bring it back rock
Number one rule if your ass get popped
Don't chatterbox to the Matlocks
Death before dishonor I'mma honor the code they created
Number 2 Rule and it might sound rude but yep... fuck you pay me
I drown my pain in porsches
I lost my partner to the bullshit
Still tryna hold on to my religion so
I put a couple diamonds in the crosses
Close your eyes see the darkness
That's what it's like where I'm from
No lawyers no doctors
So either I go the hardest
Or I could just call this a night
On dark nights its like I see better
On Dark Knights I'm like Heath Ledger
Even if I overdose on drugs
Motherfuckers can't kill my buzz
Wait I ain't done
I'mma freestyle this Khaled let it run
What's the hardest county in the Yayo
Cause ima go harder then they go
I'mma go harder than Baltimore
Philly gone say they can't touch the boy
Where you at Duval?
I'mma go harder than you all
Harder than New York
Turn the Pro Tools in the booth off
I'mma go harder than Ye go
And Ye go hard
skrrt skrrt
I think it's time for me to go hard for the hood I'm from
skrrt skrrt
DJ Khaled
Fuck the rest, we run the game
Kanye West, Khaled and Pain
I go hard [?] I go unreal
I grind hard, make music that you feel
[?], motherfuckers keep speaking
So it's time for you to listen
Yo, Khaled, this so Luguz
The one you never thought would've made it, but he does
He did, he is, the best
The rest can rest, unless I die in flesh
I rest my case, I bless my fate
I played my hands without a spade
You hate to hear the bars I drop
You hate the fact I'm near the top
Hate to hate, shit, [?]
You would hate me too with the rhymes I talk
The rhymes I live, the rhymes I spit
It's gonna keep me going, it's going make me rich
I already did, I leave it you
Middle finger in the air, n*gger, fuck you!
I'mma keep my [?], spit perfection, I am dope, I'm baking soda
Cut in ages, [?]
[?] for greatness, I'm forsaken
I go hard, that's an understatement
I gotta go hard, I gotta go hard
With the flow of my beach coast
I've gotta show off, I've gotta show off
[?] with the teeth I floss
I'm so so sickening, no more convincing
Lyrically, I beat my odds
[?], no more [?]
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
With the peace and the people and the sound
Let the game slip away, let the name slip away
So I'm back in the middle of the streets now
With the words and the flow, I'm [?]
And we go by the runners
skrrt skrrt
DJ Khaled, we the best
skrrt skrrt
I'm goin in, I'm goin in
I do it for the hood, cause the hood told me I should
skrrt skrrt
If you rep yo' hood and you goin' hard
If the they hatin' on you don't stress,
Tell them niggas that we the best
skrrt skrrt
You can't stop this
Fuck the best, we run this game
Kanye West, Khaled, and Pain
If you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me,
You should already figure I'mma go hard
If you was as real as me,
You would never let another nigga step in yo yard
Makin money ain't shit to me
Cause it's in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live, you gots to go hard
I am gettin it in until the end,
I got to go, go, go, go hard
I go the hardest
Flow so retard
I'm disgusted with myself
I mean ughh, where do I start?
First I spin around and vomit
Then I shit up on it
Fuck the beat up so bad won't nobody get up on it, I
Flow sick, nigga how sick, sea sick
Got your hand out, don't look at me bitch
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I have some wins, some losses
Just a life of a god damn boss's
With the top off, lookin' for a girl with a ass as fat as Tracy Ross's
This is dope as it get,
Dope as a mother fuckin' acid trip,
Fly as 57 passengers
This finna be another classic bitch
Everybody know I got it, if you want it, then get at it
But I ain't gon have it,
No I ain't gon have it
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
(Go) go, go, go, go, go, go
And on the count of three everybody run back to your fantasy, now
(Go) She was a bad uh
The type at the club niggas would grab her
(Go) Fantasized when I had her
In the bathroom sweatin' with her ass up
(Go) The body of a dancer
We had chemistry cause she was a Cancer
Thought forever it would last for
But forever move faster, so I had to
(Go) Still I gotta pause
When I think about her in them draws
(Go) And uh, ooh baby she liked it raw and
Like rain when she came it poured
(Go) And like a car that I can't afford
I would want it then want some more
The positions our frames explored let me know
Watch out for me, I'm bound to glow...
You better watch out for me, I'm bound to glow
Your boy all glowed up
Every time we touch down, bet it go up
'Member doin' shows, ain't nobody show up
Pour your heart out, ain't nobody show love
They used to laugh when my whip was on the tow truck
'Til me and bein' broke finally broke up
skrrt skrrt
Time to shake the dice, time to change the li-i-ight
No more 9 to 5, autopilot dri-i-ive
Used to work the fries, now we supersi-i-ize
We go suit and tie, we gon' touch the sky-y-y
We so certified, we so certifi-i-ied
Fuck you haters still, that's an F-Y-I-I-I
They gon' bang this here all summerti-i-ime
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Turn me way up, my voice is really low
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay
Watch out
Watch out, why nigga?
The cops out, cops out
It's all love when I ride top down
Top down
I started out way down low
Started from the bottom, now we here now
skrrt skrrt
We about to get the whole nine
The whole nine, we just landed on a gold mine
We the new Abu Dhabi, this is our time
""I got fury in my soul
Fury's gonna take me to the glory goal
In my mind I can't study war no more.""
Gonna take you to the glory

That's Louis Vuitton bitch

Two years the Dwayne Wayne became the Dwyane Wade
And A
Please don't start me
I'm like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley
I'm pop the barkers, I'm hood like parkers
While you all was in limbo I raised the bar up
I touched on everything
Married to the game rock a chain stead of a wedding ring
You all braides names catch the garter
On nights when romance
Cameras flash so much
That I gotta do that yayo dance
I'm on a world tour with Common my man
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van
It's easy
The hood love to listen to jeezy and weezy and o yeah yeezy

Now its gon be a problem like a brand new installment from the late great Mr. Christohper Wallace
They call us pompus
Can I be honest? Honestly, Modesty wouldn't ever end my policy
Apology accepted, you ain't say it? Shoulda said it
As soon as I did, all the Bullshit was deaded
skrrt skrrt
I'm not a one girl's guy... (real talk for ya, peep game)
Ain't they know it, when it comes to love, I don't lie (we don't lie man)
And the girls respect me for it (you gotta respect that)
Ain't gonna say my nose can't be open (I may never say never)
But right now it's just too many fine ladies out there to choose one from
(too many ladies, ha)
skrrt skrrt
I love girls, girls, girls, girls, girls I do adore
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Whoo! Who you lovin, who you wanna be huggin, heh
Who you wit, who you wanna be fuckin
Got this smarty art chick to whom I pose this question
I read a couple books to add to her soul's progression
To put this in laymen's term, I gave her some knowledge
She gave me, brains in return, she had to drop out of college
Knowin she does this homework, I give her in house tutoring
In and out I'm movin through her student body union and
She, call me professor, say daddy come and test her
So she could fail on purpose and repeat the semester
I'm like, at this rate ma you never graduate
She said, I ain't no fool I'll make it up in summer school
I love girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, I do adore
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Now let the people sing
I'm tryin girls out, (just tryin girls out) just tryin girls out
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Huh, who you lovin, who you wanna be fuckin
Who said what, why you trippin girl, why's you fussin?
It's Kanye West straight outta Chi-Town
Super producer brought you joints like
H to the Izzo, Takeover and that new Scarface single
And I'm chillin with the leader of the new school
Absolute heavy hitters y'all
Yo...
I'm Kanye To The, first of all coming straight from the Chi
Uh, I don't lie
It's like the singer say
I've been known to do beats like that, know what I'm saying
Brought you hits such as
skrrt skrrt
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Gimme some brain before I hop up on this plane
Gotta head right back to the Chi
Now even though I went to college and dropped outta school quick
I always had a Ph.D.: a Pretty Huge Dick
Ladies tired of getting ripped off by guys like this
And giving head is like a whale that's using a toothpick
Well, I'm in the club for a limited time only
Two way or phone me, if you tryna bone me
Yo man got money, you still feel lonely
Claim he love you, it's no doubt, it's Gwen Stef-phony
You a light skinneded Nia, dark skinneded Tamia
Black Jennifer Lopez, a ghetto senorita
skrrt skrrt
We can talk on my cell, but not Nokia
It be going in and out that's why I barely hear ya
It be going in and out like a robberia
I'm tryna take this money like Rob and G-Dep
And I'mma take you to my house like Trick and Trina
Chi-Town, Chi-Town, big city of dreams
And my dick so big it can't fit in my jeans
And a bitch so mad she can't get in my cream
And it gets so bad she wanna tear up my things
But still 
Yeah, they tried to put me in a box
It's impossible
Are-Les
(Oh yeah)
And this time it's all or nothing
(Set it real, oh yeah)
skrrt skrrt
I'ma take you 10 rounds like a boxer baby
Show you how I put down with rocks, my lady
Promise you asking when I'm done for more
I'ma switch it up and make life comfortable
I'ma be the reason you're not sleeping baby
I'ma invade the thoughts you keeping maybe
If you're still not convinced, I'll tell you more

You're the reason I quit the game for
Can't explain just how much you shine
Give me your heart, I'll give you mine
I'm putting my future on the line
Baby it?s just you and I
From this day on let's make a deal
I'll stay true, you keep it real
Don't be shy 'bout how you feel

And I'ma bring Dame and HOV mad more cream
Hooks galore
Leave your city shook for sure
And I'ma bring 'em back where Beans took 'em before
For the last time it's 'Kanye' and not Kane
Everybody mispronouncing the name
So I spell it over and overlike my dog Fab in the game
Pick a bad chick up like a cab in the rain
All the girls that I had was the same
Cuz all they seemed to care about is what I had in the chain
Nevertheless, I'll say it again
Drop the bad bitch off take a cab in the rain
Go! Why she wanna say 'hello,'
Cuz my Rock-a-fello piece is all yellow?
Yeah! She tryna get nice
Get a crib, get a ring, throw rice
No, keep that raggedy chick
She's so masculine and I ain't on that faggoty shit
My diamond ornaments help me fornicate
Girls that look like they on a porno tape
My dogs is warning me 'bout girls is wanting me
For child support, this money born to make
They stick safety pins in my magnums

Yo, it started out in East NewYork
Where I grew up, learned how to walk
Favorite carry weapon was a fork
Older folks smoked out, straglers
Almost had to bust a Marvin Haglar
Starvin' for mine, bust three at ya
Dad fucked up consecutively
Him and some relatives is Gangsters, sellin' Pussy
Moms dropped him on the spot
Smacked me in the knot
Only he gave you was your name and these blocks
Yup, thats ya Pops
Still, thats me still
Keep it real
If it wasn't for him and his steel there probably wouldn't be a meal
We in his Caddy siliconed out, zoned out
Three days away from home he come back stoned out
Coke on the table, pressin' redial
Son I'm sendin' you home, nigga you foul
Yo, why you doin' that? but gettin' big
Half the niggas I run wit' gettin' jig
The other fifty cent balancin' a bid
Oh shit, got this bitch seeded
To God I pleaded
What should I do? knock your self off, but the God succeeded
And the most scariest part is you better have heart
Cause the Lions and wolves will rip you apart
Have Faith in your God
Shoot joints, get involved
Put tints on your windows, whip cars

Same rules apply, I'm back on top
You can't drink or smoke if you not gon' pop
See me in the popcorn drop, not gon' stop
Takin shots of Catron, gettin top on yachts
The medallion's a mountain, rock on rocks
The whole world wanna know when this lock gon' drop
Without a doubt, she acknowledge the wealth
Since she ain't give brains, I told her let me get some knowledge of self
Then I told her be proud of yourself and dig deep
And try to see what you could get out of yourself
After all that, I told her to fall back
The Ferrari truck parked in the back is all black
Next time, bring some friends and more 'gnac
It depends how I feel in the morn' if I call back, what
Yeah, Kanye to the, yeah
I'm with this bad Ethiopian chick, drinkin' straight up liquor

Ya honey love me, she admire the fashion
And I call her baby girl, just like her dad did
There's 100's on my paper like a smart ass class kid
Because I'm on top my route, like an ad lib
And you should holla mamma, Dolce and Gabbana mamma
Gotta a whole lot o' mamma, Fendi and the Prada so you need to
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
But to get boy you gotta be rich or something
And my attire hard, hard like my dick or something

And living my dreams 'til the point you should pinch me to convince me

Brooklyn wins again
It's the Stuy, it's the Bush, dem niggas again
Ta' Kweli, Mighty Def, and S. Dot on the guest lock
Kanye, you're the dope man in hip hop, now let's rock
Now roll out niggas, my hometown niggas
I get it good in your hood so slow down niggas
Watch the speed though, mind your pedal and ease off
Or screech into a collision course with these walls - bam!
They don't move, don't pray, don't lose, don't sleep
Life passin', light flasin', life happens that fast part a gun
Black hands up in prayer
Black guns up in fear
Dyin' wish is to touch the air
Seekin' heaven that wasn't here
Eyes will not see another year
It's another day
It's the same fight
Different round, sound the bell
Mix it up in victory where you live it up the beat
And get risen up you're knocked down get it back and get it up
Get off of queer street and get with us
And get clear where we did it
From the heart, from the people
From the top, from the jeep
From the gut, from the street
From my soul to the mic to the essence
So in my absence you feel the presence, exactly
I make contact, for short, I MC
Me and mine we don't just get by
We get free and that's ready [Mos -- nigga]
skrrt skrrt
Just to get by
Nigga I sold coke, nigga I pushed lah
Carried a fo'five
Claimed I was ready to die
Promised never to cry
Held it all inside
Reality was too much to take so I
Kept my mind fried
Slept for most of mine
Soon as I closed my eyes
Then I woke up behind
Thinkin' either I load up these nines
Or blow up with rhymes
Cause this flow of mine is like blow up but lines of coca
And your folks think Hov' just wrote stuff to rhyme
Nah, I'm a poster for what happened seein your moms
Doin five dollars worth of work just to get a dime
So pardon my disposition
Why should I listen to a system that never listened to me?
Picture me working McDonald's
I'd rather pull a mac on you
Sorry Ms. Jackson but I'm packin
skrrt skrrt
It's something about that Nina Simone's piano flow 
It's like a Michaelangelo painted a portrait of Maya Angelou 
And gave it to a sick poet for they antidote 
If music get's you choked up this is the tree and a rope 
This is Chi nigga, I'm mista all-a-dat 
Fuck a map, let's put this bitch on the almanac 
Dice what they hittin' for, ' lax what you sittin' on 
Tracks who you spittin on, rap till we get it on 
And don't let nobody with the power to sign
Ever tell you you ain't got the power to rhyme 
They used to tell me toughen up
Put some bass in your voice 
They used to tell me lighten up

Couldn't understand why haters joked around
I wanted to be free with other creatures like me
And now I got my wish, cause i know that I'm a gay fish (gay fish)
skrrt skrrt
(I'm a fish yo) goin' on a gay fish
(It's alright girl) makin' love to other gay fish
All those lonely nights at the grocery store
In the frozen fish aisle feelin' like a whore
Cause I wasn't being true
Even though everyone said that I had to make a switch
(Gay fish) now I know that I'm a gay fish (gay fish)
skrrt skrrt
(I'm a fish yo) Goin' on a gay fish
(Now I'm where i belong girl) makin' love to other gay fish
I used to be scared, denying who I was
Acting straight but then going out to the gay fish clubs
Dancing with the Marlins making out with the all the Snappers
I'd take a Salmon home and work that Coddle Fin for hours
But now I'm out and I'm free to love what I want

Light as a rock, gonna light up the block
Don't believe in cases, goin all out
Paintin' faces, switch my picture, like tradin' places
For that money what?
Everybody hands up, or hands down money tucked
I flip the money trucks, money I don't give a fuck
Ay money, shut the fuck up
It's only a stickup
You don't stand a chance, give it quick up
You 'bout to turn into an ambulance pickup
Enough with the cocky stuff, fuck all that stocky stuff
Don't get smacked like a hockey puck
I ain't wit' that rocky stuff
I'm strapped got this gat (Blah blah blah blah)
What?
Gangsta gangsta, tell me how you do it
It seems so simple, like there was nothing to it
One more time run through it, everybody hands up
Alright hands down money tucked

I'm high off them cocktails
Dangerous gone broke, my aim is no joke
Duct taped, roped, strangle your folks
Box cut across the throat (nope)
Bang the four 'till it's broke
Prey on niggas in a circlular pattern
Catch you playin' craps, car in reverse

Im getting this nigga in the morning
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Well let me be the first to get mine, Ohh!
Okay I'm chillin' in my camo, flippin' through the channel
On my GOOD Music shit, my logo's a Lambo
Four doors of ammo, ammunition I'm pitching
To make your body switch another position
And listen, my weed loud, fuck her and speed off
Tell 'em I bare arms, I'm cuttin my sleeves off
Lettin' my tats show and I sag my pants
Im letting my ass show, I'm hot as tabasco
I study, Castro, yeah, my plug from Cuba
Inside of the car is like a damn computer
Inside of the crib is like a damn museum
You ain't seen these before, you better get 'em on film
Tryin to take these fat pockets, man your chances are slim
Disrespect, you stomp em out, man give em a Tim
You ain't did what I did, see I know I'mma win
Funk Flex
Yeah, G-Unit
You understand whats about to happen?
Huh .. huh? (do you understand?)
Nigga guess who's bizzack
It's not Beanie Sieg' or Jay-Hov'
50 Cent y'all niggas should know
Don't make me relapse
Run up on your ass with the fo'
You punk nigga I done told you before
Fuck being in a cage, man that shits for the birds
I do my dirt in the hood, but I live in the burbs
When you talk be careful how you choose your words
Cause I send niggas to put ya fuckin brains on the curb
Am I my brother's keeper? Yes I am
Nigga you know they gettin low you see that gun in my hand
G-Unit, don't go fuckin with my soldiers, boy
Get laid out, im'a say I told you boy
See you rollin with 20 niggas, we rolling with 20 guns
16 hollows is loaded in every one
I know you slow, so
Well, I'm a make a lot of money
(Make a lot of money)
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this
(Quit this)
Crazy scene
skrrt skrrt
Well I'm a quit this crazy scene
Cause being famous ain't all what they make it to be
But back then y'all this was my favorite dream
But now, I wouldn't hesitate I would leave
Cause I'mma
skrrt skrrt
I'm a quit this crazy scene
Cause everything you see ain't really how it be
Please don't believe in that TV screen
I'm sorry kids but there's no such thing
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Well I'm gonna quit this crazy scene
skrrt skrrt
Cause this is what I waited to be
Bein' on stage was amazin' to me
But now I'm in the game, it ain't the way that it seems
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
And I don't know how to feel
When this
Dream of mine used to be so real
I would anything just to sign a deal
But now I trade it all for a home cooked meal
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Oh, what?
You say it could be worse?
Well step in my shoes, put yourself in my shirt
I'm only human y'all so we all gotta work
But sometimes I wonder why I even came to this earth
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Look
Cause they don't care about us
They just use us up
Leave us in the dust
And it roughs me up
So much I could cuss
skrrt skrrt
Enough's enough
I want out of these cuffs
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Sometimes I just feel hopeless
Pacin' back and forth, man I can't even focus
So I'm always smokin' in the booth recordin'
Cause my mind races
Like Jeff Gordon
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
It ain't supposed to be so hard
I always said I'd quit if it felt like a job
I'd rather be pissed than pretend that I'm not
And try to play along with the whole facade
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
It ain't a question to me
Look at me
I know what I'm destined to be
This is spiritual y'all
I'm wrestlin' beasts
10 Days?
Are you for real?
Are you serious?
Fuck it then!
Fuck you tahm bout?
Nigga, fuck you tahm bout?
Nigga, fuck this whole school and everything you tahm 'bout
Don't ask me for no I.D., bitch I fucking signed out
Bitch I've been suspended, bitch I've been on timeout
Waking up in grind mode and sleeping in a grindhouse
So please don't hit my line 'bout the party trying to find out
What time that shit going to start or when it end, or who gone come out
Or if I walked the stage, I've been on stage since I could rhyme out
Shows and shows and tapes of trying to get my fucking lines out
So please don't take my BIC out
My book out, my pick out, my hair, my fucking big mouth
You dick head you dipped out of class and now you shit out
Of luck Who fucking slick now, and with them rhymes you written down
I hope you get a mix down with a diss track
From Ms. Rownd and my dick sack in this bitch mouth
Yeah, I feel good
Pretty good
Feeling like I'm 'bout to go in
Yep, OK
I gots no coins, gots no cash
But if you want gold check underneath the stache
I mean mustache
Sweater's from the Goodwill, if you must ask
Was saving at the thrift store
Way before Macklemore
Setting up genius bars like on the Apple Store
(Damn!)
And shout out to the Apple Store
Put a pencil to my iPad and it don't work no more
Picked up the phone, called customer service
Hung up when the lady's sexy voice made me nervous
(You messed up)
Shoulda asked her for a date
She coulda gone to my rap show on the eighth
Called right back this time, got a dude
Just invited him didn't want to be rude
Now, he's my friend from the Apple Store
Broke my phone screen when it dropped on the floor
Said he'd hook me up with like 25 more
UPS delivered right to my front door
I could keep a few if I just signed a form
Then came a knock at a quarter to four
Two boys in blue said they heard I got a score
Could be lookin' at you
skrrt skrrt
If you'd handled what I'd taken
skrrt skrrt
No fine line, don't have to be dead right
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I'm Francis
Still dreamin' of a glory
Of somethin' new
I can't remember what it's like
skrrt skrrt
It's all good though
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Don't wanna know if you made mistakes
Now what if Michael Jordan decided to stick to baseball and Jay-Z decided to stick to crack
Just Blaze decided to stick to engineering and Kanye never decided to rap?
What if a nigga from the Chi that was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking about coke and birds, it was more like spoken word
'Cept the nigga's really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
skrrt skrrt
But kept in mind as long as [?] folks and niggas is dead broke
Some things they gone never change
But it ain't them [?] folks, it's the white folks that brought us over here with boats and tight ropes

skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
A little woozy but I'm nice now
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
The rings all ring out
Burn out, cave in
Blackened to dark out
I'm mixed now, fleshed out
(with Rihanna & Paul McCartney)
I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want
Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin', I'm positive
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Hombre bienvenido, En?gma al microfono
No, non chiedere chi è, mica sei al citofono
Spreco rime in freestyle
Dove il gusto più elettronico rispetta anche il sapore del grammofono
Ehi, certe cose muoiono, altre no
Non sei Napoleone, gendarme in questione
Ed anche se fosse, zitto per favore
Dà fuoco a 'sti cannoni più che a Waterloo
Oh oh, giù da me c'è Folclore
Quello dell'anti-droga anche di notte con gli occhiali da sole
Gira voce sia pappone, fattone
Non vale mezza strofa di ogni nostra canzone
Me la rido no problem
Magari vuoi picchiare, dimmi tu quando e dove
skrrt skrrt
Victory won, in a world of Henessey and guns
Too young for the marches but I remember these drums
The stark reality of wars and battles
We fought for ours, caught in ghetto tragedy
I talk to my aunt named Mattie Lee
And recognize the importance of family
Hand me a joint, good music, and room to breathe
Those that doubt Com' will soon believe
Can't judge the weave, my lady had one
I'm more like a fool for soul and passion
The price of gas rises, street life is pumpin' fast, lives is
I watched Crash and realize that we all survivors
No religion or race could ever describe us
My guys do dirt, move dirt, but never really talk about it
Forever begins just because I thought about it
Living once again
We live
Then you're gone
Ashes and snowfalls
I wonder when the roll call for heaven gon' come
Forever gon' come
It's a cold world and I can never go numb
Look fear in the eyes, say I never gon' run
Sooner then later, I know the cheddar gon' come
For now I write the world letters to better the young
On tree by jury, together we hung
Now we let our chains hang and gang bang to maintain
'Ghanistan goin' through the same thing
It trickles down, at each other we aim pain
I shoot for stars, peace and exclusive cars
Through the ride I learned to earn hard
Watch gangstas turn God in the midst of war
No matter how much I elevate, I kiss the floor
It was in the wind when she said Dilla was gone
That's when I knew we'd live forever through song

Throwbacks and Timbs, blacks and rims
Whether on ball courts, attires of all sorts
Bir dakikalığına bekliyordum
Kadınım için
Böylece bunu bu fahişelerden biri için riske atmayayım diye
Limitler olmadan yaşıyordum
İşimin gittiği yere kadar
Tek kontrolde olan benim
Bana verilen her şeyi hissediyordum
Çocuklarım için
Sevdiklerim için öleceğim
Tanrım, umuyorum ki
Bunu görevim haline getireyim
Kadınlardan vazgeçeceğim
Sahip olduklarımın yarısını kaybetmeden önce
Düşünüyordum
Vizyonum hakkında
Duygularımı duşa vurup
skrrt skrrt
Ruhumun
Ruhumun katmanları
skrrt skrrt
Hayatımı s*kip atmamı umuyorlar
Bana ulaşmalarına izin veremem
Ve her zaman hayatımı s*kip atsamda
Bundan sadece ben söz edebilirim
Gör, senin gitmene izin vermeden önce
Bilmeni istediğim son bir şey
Asla bu zenciden daha deli bir şey görmedin
Lexapro'sunu (anti depresan) almadığı zaman
Meksika'daki son zamanı hatırlıyor musun?
Son zamanı hatırlıyor musun, bölümü?
Niye kodla mesaj attığımı sorduğun?
I been waiting, for a minute
For I [?]
Pour out, everything
Pour out, everyday

Last down I'm down in Mexico
Asking my why the hell I test the cove
Four times I say don't test me hoe
Told you four times don't test me hoe
Now we finna lose all self control
skrrt skrrt
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
And I..
I wish I would let ahead and fuck my life up
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
For my, lady
So I can’t jeopardize that for one of these hoes
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I been feeling all I’m giving
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
God I’m willing
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Revealing the layers to my soul, my soul
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Can’t let them get to me
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
See before I let you go, one last thing I need to let you know
You ain’t never seen nothing crazier than
skrrt skrrt
Remember that last time in Mexico
Remember that like time the episode
skrrt skrrt
Four times that you say don’t text me hoe
I've been waiting for a minute
Pour out, ayy
For my lady, and I
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt

skrrt skrrt
Four times that you say don't text me hoe

Now we finna lose all self-control
skrrt skrrt
Especially when we in a Giuseppe store
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
And I...
[Pre-Hook: Travis Scott]
Wish I would let a hater fuck my life up
Can't let 'em get to me
Say that name, I just might have to pipe up
skrrt skrrt
You may see me in cars and clothes
But all this money can't make me happy
See this life ain't all I know
skrrt skrrt
I guess you suppose
That all this money can make you happy
So skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Now I would wish you the best
And I would wish you success
But I would never want to wish you my stress
These haters would love to see holes through my tissue and flesh
And I assume if they miss you, you blessed
And the pretty women don't even want to kiss you unless
You in a Mitchell & Ness
Or you push through the best
But when I speak I make sure every issue's addressed
Before they twist you and mess
And try to diss you in press
And most cops want to frisk you I guess
They figure rap stars always move with the pistol and vest
skrrt skrrt
It ain't easy as it looks with me
Some execs is as greasy as the crooks would be
Some women are as sleezy as the hookers be
And how I'm supposed to do right with with so much wrong around me
Get rid of the weak
And keep the strong around me
Everybody who come along belong around me you know
skrrt skrrt
For my lady
So I can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes
skrrt skrrt

Let me get my theme music (x2)
'Aye, Let me get my theme music (x2)
Baby, just forget everything that you know
Let's take it all the way back to hello
They say you livin' like you died before
I got a place that only I can go
skrrt skrrt
(We'll learn to fly)
skrrt skrrt
(Above all the lights)
You've never been so high, kiss the ground goodbye
And you say, damn baby how did you get that fly?
Flight school
I got the airplane passes, the aviator glasses
She be lookin fly like aviator classes
So classy, Jacqueline Onassis
Used to sneak and move like Ali, Cassius
Massive, like Kennedy's assassin
We was killin' time like clocks in the casket
Perhaps its time to prevail
I'll show you Gotham City like I'm Christian Bale
I can be Barack and let you be Michelle
Miguel
Gizelle
Dress fresh as hell
Louis
Gucci
Ye in that pastel
Adore Dior, ride down Lake Shore
She felt the vibe, I had to make sure
She felt deprived livin like she died
[Produced by Kanye West, Mike Dean and Noah Goldstein]
I'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm
And the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold
My blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones
It keeps my veins hot, the fires find a home in me
I move through town, I'm quiet like a fight
And my necklace is of rope, I tie it and untie it
skrrt skrrt
And now people talk to me, but nothing ever hits home
People talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes
I'm done with it (ooh)
This is the start of how it ever ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
skrrt skrrt
We're at the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars, there's so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them

What do I know? (Flashing lights)
I know it's been a while sweetheart
We hardly talk, I was doing my thang
I know it was foul, baby
Aye babe, lately, you've been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
Fronting though: yo, I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago
It'll go get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no F.E.M.A
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass

What do I know?

Pharmaceuticals bought me charm like the jeweler jewels
Squares of ice shed light like the Rubix cube
I get it mixed up, red with the blues
And she all mixed up, admirin' the hues
Four years later, niggas admirin' your shoes
Bape year late, we call you Tokyo buffoons
'Cause stylists admire us, look at how you groom
Keep runnin' to SoHo, them exclusives in my room
Niggas is biters, we let you slide with your writings
We knew that cocaine talk was not like you
But who goes as far as tryin' to dress like him?
One sequin glove can never make you Michael
I moonwalk over tracks and make niggas spiteful
But never hear a word 'cause them niggas know
That my flow so viper and if Pusha go psycho
He'll seance that pen and pull your spirit up out yah, P

[Refrain: Ne-Yo]
skrrt skrrt
Let me show you what you've been missing (Phally Phel on the track by the way)
He's showing you the minor things
Let me show you the finer things
Let me (I make my appearance) show you what you've been missing
skrrt skrrt
Right about this time, raise your glasses
What's my motivation? That ass is
Start a conversation like as if
skrrt skrrt
Go ahead and tell the dj ""play Swiss""
Now I ain't gotta tell these hoes who I is
Bitches hatin' again, that's music to my ears
What you think my fuel was for all of these years?
skrrt skrrt
You keep me writing, so exciting
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Just to try the motherfuckers so you chain
Throw some cash, that's cake and icing
I ask her ""you blind?"" she said ""no, just sightseeing""
Maybe that's good, you just ain't found a right thing (yet)
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
He's showing you (allright) the minor things (uhuh)
Let (Cyssero) me show you the finer things (let me show you something)
Let (uhuh) me show you what you've been missing (If you knew better, you'd do better. You do better if you choose better)

Guaranteed you'll be hooked like fishes
By the fisher man when he goes fishing
Lips made for kissing, body for caressing
How coincidental, I come out the ring
Look like Sonic, how sentimental
How I can sense ya mental, ya insanity
That's the thing that keeps me in my memory
Cause there's no you, so you let me be
The best me, bet me
That I won't jump to the top like a bedspring
I'm heartless, no love, none lost
Love for me is never lost, but find your love, cause
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I bet if I give all my love
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart
Sure, I don't love you, but I don't wanna break you
Sure, I don't love you, but I don't wanna enslave you
Drake can't convince me to love you
But I don't wanna put you at stake
Cause bars be Q, fresh out the grill
I'll stick you, then kabob, that's how much I hate you
Didn't want to break it to you, but I'll snap some sense
Take a dollar of knowledge, you suck, so hence
You can't find love, cause
skrrt skrrt

I'm more than just an option (Hey, hey, hey)

And I feel it taking over

skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt

I'm more than just a number (Hey, hey, hey)

No matter how times I've tried to you
I can't lie to you, I can't lie to you, I can't
Always on my mind, I can feel it now

Coming from the back block, posted like the backdrop
Rags to the riches, got rich and bought the ragtop
Lot of homies died here, look at what the grind did
Put me in the same shoes, still do what Shyne did
More digits, more bitches, more riches
They don't want no broke niggas
But don't call them gold diggers
I don't know, I don't know, why I ain't get the picture?
Why Cosby slipped her?
Why I fucked ‘em both when they said they sisters?
Why Eazy ain't have the Magic?
Why AI never won a 'ship?
And why God took Max and Chinx
And he ain't take me when I got hit?

Ayo, rippin' y'all niggas is the easiest
Y'all style is the nacho cheesiest
Everybody wanna shine, they the greasiest
When they know they bank account is the measliest
You gotta know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to run when my niggas be rollin'
Holdin' your gun, especially if you owe 'em
Watchin' yo back, especially in the mornin'
Now niggas give you a pound and tell you, ""Be safe.""
Like you carryin' a million dollars in a briefcase
Now you're all paranoid like, ""Is this shit laced?""
My niggas come in all black like deep space
When we turn the toast
Turn you to a ghost
Any more want they girl to play Demi Moore?
As long as you sure
My point is mainly that
We maniacs
Maniacs nigga what

A lot of MCs came to my showdown
And watch me put the low down
Nothin' nice when you fightin' for your life
With the ruger, did he shoot him?
Did you see it? Was it right?
Did he deserve that? (naw)
Ask 'em maine
Did he know he turned his son to a bastard maine?
If I see him on the street, I'mma blast him maine
Have a ? and a ? in the casket maine
This guy saw me on the strip, tried to out the thang
My momma used to say, ""Never quit, baby that just don't exist!""
And just cause she'll suck ya dick, don't mean you could trust the bitch!
I'm just giving you the real
Cause I don't come from Hollywood or Beverly Hills
I'm from where mothers don't care and babies get killed
Where you gotta rob and go steal for stomachs to fill
And it's hard for a young, black nigga like myself
Where the police compare oneself with everybody else
So that means if you yourself they think you're everybody else
So I don't care 'bout no one else
Just my family and myself
Yeah, that's just my way of thinkin'
In my city and it helps cause no one gives a fuck
About me, you, or nobody else
And it's cool
I'm still livin' over East
We still chillin', sippin' lean
Smokin' swishas, stackin' hunnits to the ceilin'
We still winnin'
We just fightin' to survive
It's a shame I gotta ride with this nina on my side
They used to say...
Rings and watches, kings deposites
Chains that seemed preposterous
Gettin' paper never seemed monotonous
Time is money, the streets is watchin' like a scene from Clockers
Ok Phillip du wirst jetzt zerstört
Sag ich mal einfach nur so, du Huansohn!
Du, du dreckiger Waschbär ja
Sag deinen Eltern Bescheid MC Niggles ist am Start, du dreckiger
Ich stech dich ab undzwar auf Englisch
I'm known as MC Niggles, cause I got the biggest dick in the Universe
As if I'm doomed with a curse
I smoke weed all day
My blood thicker than clay
Cause all I do is inhale
You are a disgrace to your family
Whoa whoa whoa
Who said she can come to my house and start co-signing people that aren't me
skrrt skrrt
Who said she can come over
She's up in my house co-signing you ten fold
She's co-signing ten fold bro
What up sleeve
Uh yeah uh
Y-y-y y-y-you can call me Packi that's with a C K I
If you book me for bullshit then P-A-Y or move along
I don't got time to be wastin'
Now I ain't lookin for wifey no time to be chasin'
Only hit the bars on occasion
I rather be grindin' tryin' to turn work into vacation
All bottles on me when we make it
I do it for my squad, they don't even gotta say shit
Real dudes on my team got plenty
Chicks they betty's Brusques petty
I represent cinco uno siete (517)
My whole damn scene should be famous already
I ain't sweatin it on my next level shit
Put my bars ahead the raqs like the president
Oooh
Better than whoever they lettin in

I'm feelin myself today
I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?
Changin' your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on me
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt

Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listenin' to things you say

We lit up the city, you feel me?
My hitters is humble, we hit up the city
We skrrt off, we eat in a Bentley

I need my bitches A1
I got a lot at stake, feel me?
We at the highest level, yeah I know you feel me
Multi-million dollar deals
Got a million dollar deal
When I was younger
I would wonder how a million dollars feel
And forreal, it feel like I ain't even broke the seal
Cause when you drop hits they want you to pick up the bill
Now my, life is in Maryland
My heart is in Chicago
New York state of mind but out LA man that's where I go
When I need to lay this shit down
So much on my mind that's the reason I'm spitting now
Finally running the game and everybody tripping now
But I can't give a damn I got they bitches dripping now
Moet we sipping now
Yeah we came a long way
I know a lot of people thought they'd never see the day
That we get big like Notorious
Cause we battle like warriors
In the state of euphoria

How y'all feelin' tonight? Thank y'all for coming out to this impromptu type important performance, let me just say that right quick. I love the energy in this city - this is one of my all-time towns y'all know I stay out here. But I came here for the creativity more than anything, because creativity fuels everything
I hate business people. People get on the phone with me and tell me ya know like, 'What kind of business can you do, though? What type of business are you doing? What's the numbers? How much did you sell? What's the radio spins? How much shampoo can you sell with your face on it and shit?
Remind me again why we in this shit 
skrrt skrrt
Remind me again why we in this shit (3x)
I know it's for more than to just get rich
skrrt skrrt
Since when was making art about getting rich? 
And I know it's easy for me to say cause
Having money's not anything and not having it is 
Remind me again why we in this shit
Remind me again why the Grammys couldn't suck my dick 
Remind me again who's the original Superfly - 
And I got love for Hov but I ain't fuckin' with that ""Suit and Tie."" 
Remind me again 
Remind me again why we in this shit - 
Every nigga tryin' get rich
Every rapper tryin' get rich
And every rapper rap about fuckin' somebody else... bitch 
skrrt skrrt
And why the Grammys can suck my dick, suck my big, black dick 
And every motherfuckin' sponsor, shit
They try to put their logos all over the concerts and shit
For a meet-and-greet, and you gotta meet the execs and their daughter
And they'll show you what they just bought her 
Remind again why we in this shit -
Real niggas don't live too long in this shit. (x5) 
They say either you comin' on too strong in this shit - 
They always talkin' 'bout what I'm doing wrong in this shit 
Well I COULD GIVE A FUCK ABOUT ANYTHING, DICK 
I COULD GIVE A FUCK ABOUT ANYTHING DICK! 
skrrt skrrt
I lost my motherfuckin' mama 
So I could give a fuck about your comments 
skrrt skrrt

Young Rascal Flatts - young ass kid ass could rap
Fuck all the faculty, tobacco-packing acrobat
Back-to-back packin' bags back and forth with fifths of Jack and
Fourths of weed, I'm back to pack on hands
With young Cletus to pat my back
Real nigga with a nose ring, that's right
Just here to rap them songs
Rag on my hair, wrap weed in Vegas, rockin' Vagabonds
Sang a song, oh you don't know? What?
Well, I still bang with you
Hang with you, sip drank with you
As long as I can sang with you like:
This shit my favorite song, you just don't know the words
But I still fuck with you, you just ain't never heard
It go like: count that stack, pop that cap then down that Jack
All my niggas hit that zan, and all my ladies bounce that back

I told, I told, ay ay, I told you
Up in the morning, miss you bad
Sorry I ain't called you back
Same problem my father had
All his time, all he had, all he had
In what he dreamed
All his cash, market crashed
Hurt him bad, people get divorced for that
Drops some stacks pops is good
Momma pass in Hollywood
If you ask, lost my soul
Driving fast, lost control
Off the road, jaw was broke
'Member we all was broke
'Member I'm coming back
I'll be taking all the stacks
I got broads in Atlanta
Twisting dope, lean, and the Fanta
Credit cards and the scammers
Hitting off licks in the bando

Fuck it, I was horny
Haha, so God, please don't judge me

Cheese on Chuck E, Clicquot fuzzy
Streets gon' love me, freaks gon' fuck me
How could a young nigga be so lucky?
No Luciano, truly, I know
I done changed since I used to do the cornrow
They only give you credit at the end of movies, I know
Hustled since I learned how to use a lawnmower
From the traphouse, now I do the condo

Truckload full of keys to pianos
Aye, aye, feliz cumpleaños

Mischio ogni rimpianto alla marijuana

Quando arrivi su quel palco
E' freddo come il Polo, chiamalo Marco
Ho iniziato vendendo canne al parco
Ora lei vuole due foto con Marcio
Due foto con Marcio
Ragazza, attenta a cosa vuoi
I miei capelli sono bianchi
Come i Beastie Boys
Il flow è nero e incazzato come DMX

How's your son? (all, all, all the things, things)
He make the team this year? (all, all, all the things things)
Aw th-, they said he wasn't tall enough?
(all, all, all the glitter is not gold)
Yeah me we gon' cook this up (now gold is not a reality)
(real is what you live to be)
skrrt skrrt
And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
That's why I spit it in my songs so sweet
Like a photo of your granny's picture
Now that you're gone it hit us
Super hard on Thankgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yeah you heard the track I did man, this can't be life
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it why had guard have to look all to it?
As kids we used to laugh
Who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
And look, tell me you ain't did it, you ain't did it
And if you did, then that's family business
And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all (all the glitter) my weight in gold
Now all I know I know all these things
skrrt skrrt
And this is for everybody standin' with us
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture
Abby, remember when they ain't believe in me?
Now she like ""See, that's my cousin on TV""
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it
And y'all gon' hate it and I'm his favorite
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
But when we get together be electric slidin'
Grandma, get 'em shook up
Aw naw, don't open the photo book up
I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie, you don't wanna be rude
But every holiday nobody eatin' her food
And you don't wanna stay there cuz them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Uh uhh
skrrt skrrt
Fall back in the pussy like swoosh, swoosh, swoosh
Ballin' money woos, woos, woos
Y'all niggas got jokes, hot jokes Bruce, Bruce, Bruce
Dog, I'm about to get loose, loose, loose
All night tryna dutty wine
Woke up my dick crooked as the Nike sign
Pop's when you had me on
I could
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
This girl gon' hate me forever
skrrt skrrt

She used to get dick from Kanye West
So if you ever see her give her Kanye's best

And I don't know how you get that nigga jokes but
skrrt skrrt
And if you ever don't than get at me, at me
skrrt skrrt
We be ballin' like the athletes
The shoes you were wearing were so last week
I was rollin' around, in my mind it occurred
What if God was a her?
Would I treat her the same? Would I still be runnin' game on her?
In what type of ways would I want her?
Would I want her for her mind or her heavenly body?
Couldn't be out gettin' bogus with someone so godly
If I was wit' her would I still be wantin' my ex?
The lies, the greed, the weed, the sex
Wouldn't be ashamed to give her part of my check
Wearin' her cross, I mean the heart on my neck
Her, I would reflect on the streets of the Chi'
Ride wit' her, cause I know for me she'd die
Through good and bad call on her like I'm chirpin' her
Couldn't be jealous cause other brothers worship her
Walk this earth for her, glory, I'm grateful
To be in her presence I try to stay faithful
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I'd like to be her very best friend
He worked with her, she was his lady's best friend
Even if they don't try some ladies test men
And this was a test that was bigger than him
Some believe its the nature that is given to men
He had a good gig, a wife, a kid, a decent home
One reason or another couldn't find peace at home
She asked, ""Why do men always have to stray?""
He said, ""I'm bad, not as bad as Eric Benet""
""I used to take 'em out to eat but they wasn't really eatin'

How could i overlap?
If i didn't have no o-line

So hit em twice and help em up
And give em ice packs

So bow down and clean the kicks
Till they shine with brightness
Then spend so much

Get away from me lonliness
Get away from me fake bitches, I can't take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks

Where do the lonely kids go when the bell ring?
It's feeling like Hell rings

Imagine if I didn't have the ends
I would'nt have so many imaginary friends
I'm spaced out Dogg, I be on that moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moonwalk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we ain't finna change, so we'll never agree again
Till then I'll be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now 
Last night me and my dawg were hanging out

Off from work today so it's alright

My first album due to him, that was my biggest project
Now I'm the illest known to walk like the illest soldier
And when I smoke, only roll up with the illest doja
You sit and mull it over my venom a killer cobra
It's Harlem USA I diddy bop and shop with Oprah
(Yeah nigga, what.)
Nigga what
From my voice I'm killing 'em
I shed my blood
About everything I love
To the eye blacker, over handed face the palm smacker
Good scrapper, cat stacker, good wood packer
Tear up the Dom P wrappers faster
Platinum patrone splasher, fuck cris, spit atcha
I call it rich ignorant laughter
Black American express card all grey now, its scratched up
From constant usage, girl kidnapper, pop tags off tags
Poppa making monster music, and still I Costra Nostra
Big roaster, skin cola, girl when I send for ya
Bring friends wontcha?
I'm from the 80's NYC 5 percent of culture
Breeze through with that old school blue malaroma
Yo Jin, we good wit this one. Good looking Kanye.
You see, we the next generation of this rap game
So it's only right we got down like this Yep! Uh oh I gota love that's better than you ever was
skrrt skrrt

2x Yo I was doing a show with Kanye in the West
Mid that is so basically the Chi M.I. is up in the mix
We in the game now it makes perfect sense
The kid that dropped outta college the other never went
We take turns doing our one twos and yes yes y'alls
Look at shorty with my name tatted on her breast y'all
skrrt skrrt
(take em backstage get acquainted that's what I suggest dawg)
When it comes to spittin G I'm one of the best y'all
She looks good smell clean and she had fresh draws

Usually them type of chicks ain't good for me no! I gota love that's better than you ever was
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt

I never rock a mink coat in the sum-time like Killa Cam
Or rock some mi-mink boots in the winter time like Will.I.Am
skrrt skrrt
I just messed up on my rap, live TV like damn
But hey, hey here we again yeah
He-here we go again
People talking this but when this hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me
Now break it down
Yo, off the top of the dome, dome
Shout out to Chi-town where I call home
Coast to coast, LA to New York to London to Paris

Be light as Al B. or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet?
He was as black as the street was
skrrt skrrt
I never could see why people'd reach a
skrrt skrrt
You see how I creeped up?
You see how I played the big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I'd never rock a mink coat in the summertime like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the wintertime like will.i.am
Let me know if you feel it, man
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
People not sayin' what's not for him
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
And I'm back to tear it up
Haters, start your engines, I hear 'em gearin' up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get they hair cut
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
Cause they want gun talk or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reeboks or Adidos
Can they add that he just spazzed out at that show?
So say goodbye to the NAACP award
Goodbye to the India.Arie award
They'd rather give me the Ni-Nigga Please award
But I'll just take the I Got A Lot of Cheese award
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Everybody talkin', but when it hit the fan
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Keep the pianos goin', goin', goin', goin', goin'
And I'll keep flowin', flowin'
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt

Hey do you have any black inside you?
Would you like some? (Like some?)
Ha, you know you got a right to do whatever you like to
Don C, we got the right one, that right one
In the club, always the flyest
Always got her hands the highest
She stopped drinking Diet Coke
She on that coke diet
She bat, she bat her eyelids
That girl is so wired
I know she so tired, but ooh, she on fire
Hundred dollar bill, look at you, look at you
A hundred dollar bills, this ain't new, this ain't new
From that Paris, Lindsay, Britney, Mary-Kate and Whitney
People say that they clean, motherfucker don't bullshit me
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
All the girls standing in the (all the girls standing in the)
skrrt skrrt
You left your nigga home
You said you at your sister's
You and your girlfriends' wrong
You in here taking pictures
You ain't gotta tell us
You spending daddy's cash
Your girlfriend's jealous
You got the fattest ass
One down to pee, one trying to leave
It's hot as fuck but you just dying to ski
It's clear as black and white, like a fat panda
Your brain is Magic City
Your nose is Atlanta
I said think about your future
You can't do that tomorrow
But you don't hear a word, you see that SLR
You like ""Hey Pharrell, I ain't trying to kill your mood
But I can do the Star Trak sign; see? Killa dude""
What's good, good? And what's good, evil?
And what's good, gangstas? And what's good, people?
And whys God's phone die every time that I call on Him?
If his son had a Twitter wonder if I would follow him
Swallow them synonyms like cinnamon Cinnabon
Keep all them sentiments down to a minimum
Studious Gluteus Maxim models is sending him
Pics of they genitalia tallied up ten of 'em
I slurped too many pain-kills, down I'm off a lot
I got a lot off days but it ain't often that I'm off the clock
Ya Kna Wha Mean, I got the Chicago Blues
We invented rock before the Stones got through
We just aiming back cause the cops shot you
Buck buck bang bang, yelling ""Fuck Fox News!""
Booyaka buckle up, mothafuck opps too
Ain't no knuckling up 'em young cause it just not cool
[Bridge: Chance The Rapper]
Nice to see you Father New Year
Middle finger Uncle Samuel
Shooting death with weighted dice
skrrt skrrt
Or they heard me on the radio
Tip tried to tell me but damn I wouldn't listen
Ye' tried to tell me but man I wouldn't listen
skrrt skrrt
What would you do if it was you in my position?
skrrt skrrt
And they put me in the damage zone
skrrt skrrt
So for now I'm just laying low
skrrt skrrt
Cons, what makes you think you are any better than the rest?
If your homies wouldn't flip on you for a check
They try to stick you up for that chain around your neck
Even if they did man there is no disrespect
It's the rules of engagement, you just got engaged
Tryin to rewrite history before they turn the page
But that's when they turn and aim
Shit you better learn the game
I mean what you thought would happen once you finally got ya stacks up
The same boy who would tell them fools to back up
Is mad as hell when he sees you hold your plaques up
To get them dranks in him (now he wanna act up)
To tell the friend who tell the friend to tell the friend
And since there's strength in numbers, jealousy begins
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I like the way that you move
And girl you know how I do
It's in your hip
I want to get right between your strip
Use it like Lancome lipstick
Scarlett, and frankly I really do care, madam
All you will, this is Sa-Ra fam, now back to ma'am
I know that you can move like that I saw you dance
And now you you gotta show out, make me a fan
Turn up the fan, we gonna sweat crazy
What's your favorite Gatorade, lady
Hadn't been shopping, Perrier water maybe
I hope you ain't hungry got mash but no gravy
But we can make some, the best of both juices
We can use this, this some new shit
Make it hot like Crisco
That's how my flow go, shorty you ain't know?
If you ain't po, stop being so high post
My music ain't just for the siditty and pretty it's for
Yo, I'mma rise to the top cause it ain't in me to fail
Or die bustin' at the cops before they send me to jail
The same nigga ya serve with won't even send you the bail
And sail with some niggas tryin' to send me to hell
So whether
Rap or crack
Beats or streets
This summer I'm rockin' ice to beat the heat
Now I'm gonna cop a Benz 6 and tell 'em ""Keep the Jeep
Keep the receipt, keep the change, keep the game.""
As long as I keep the fame and keep my name
Kanye to the
Motherfuckin' West
She said, ""You from The Outfit?""
skrrt skrrt
Get that kids take that kick, hands in that bitch
skrrt skrrt
I just penetrate and quit playin’ with that bitch
Man, you got to hate it
Man, I’m motivated
Man, I’m underrated
Over-overstated
Rappin’ over thirty
Talkin’ out related
That’s captivated
Number 9 I dated
Your shit, I dated
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I just penetrate and quit playin' with that bitch
–Verse 1: A$AP Rocky & (Kanye West)–
Too fresh, man, to be a class clown
Graduated when I sat down
They don't want you to show your ass
Had the Yeezy spazzes in the background
Let's talk about the Raf now
Let's talk about the stash now
Hella niggas send my ho's up
All you bitches get passed down (bitch)
Every now and then, on the Act, wow
Maybe sing a little, bitch I act wild
Bitches rubbing on me like a frat child
On London town, bitches packed down (bitch)
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Man, you got to hate it, man you got to hate it

~Act 1: Awakening~
Rashaad. Rashaad! Come on, you gotta wake up bro. It's been too long
It's no use. He's been like this since last night
I guess just let him wake up on his own
What's he dreaming about?
Drowning down a dream state
Living lucid looking through the world that we've made
Bleeding blue would be the ink of pens that create
Flowing fluid through serene places in my mind at times to replace
Bad emotions, lack of focus making me hate
Reality and it's forces battling to make me wake
Up, and I'm sorry for whatever act is after me
This is Act 2 of my rad tunes, a masterpiece
I call “Azlyn”
I hear chaos in mind-states I pass within but do not care what's happening
In the real world, all of our souls were trapped within
A box of hopes and passion eventually thrown in trash by them
Non believers, non achievers, recycled garbage leaders
Who justify idiocy like people who follow Beiber
Number 1, maybe 2 if I should ball like Jeter
While travelling to new worlds, skating though all the meters
And this could be eternity
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
This is the start of a new life, I'd rather spend my birth in sleep
This could be eternity
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Welcome to Azlyn
[Interview: Kanye West]
“I have other goals and other things. And I'm gonna use my platform, every platform, to stand up and say, ‘I want to make something'... to say, people don't stand up to protect their dreams. People are too scared of getting, you know, spoofed in a way. And the irony of it is, think about a creative person in school… You're probably picturing them all the way in the back of the class sketching or maybe getting beat up… because creatives have gotten beat up my entire life”
[Dialogue: HighRider121 & jResonance]
Hey, you're finally awake! I was watching this interview and you came to mind because it's Kanye and, well, you know. Anyway, while you were asleep you were mumbling something about this world. Some kind of fantasy. What was that about?
Bro
What's up?
What if...
That was all a dream, now it seems that me, yes I, have woken up?
Didn't I control enough of Azlyn? Was I bold enough?
What if…
She said I don't spend time like I really should
She said she don't know me anymore
I think she hates me deep down, I know she does
She wants to erase me
A couple days, no talking, I see my baby
And this what she tells me
She said: I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works, I can't get away from you, no
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
It's like I'm her new nightmare, she ain't escaping
It makes me feel a bit complete
Knowing someone you love don't feel the same way about ya
Memories they soon delete
A couple weeks, no talking, I see my baby
I missed you so damn much
Hey, I wish we could start over, I told my baby
This what this bitch tells me
She said: I keep on running, keep on running, and nothing works
I can't get away from you, no
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Life's good I wouldn't have it another way
I might move but believe I wouldn't run away
I ain't takin' 'em all, I'm takin' the closest
We're movin' to the coast where nobody knows us
A fresh start, a clean slate
Flirtin' with destiny, it's a dream date
And I don't wanna sleep quite yet
I wanna hit the club and kill a tight set
Backstage like MJ on the flight deck
While he's rappin' Brian Russel's trying to do the mic check
But when I crossover it's game time
Teenage girls and gangsters cheer at the same time
A toast, to everything positive
Imma make the most of every dollar I'm depositin'
And I do like ketchup, I put it on everything
Bread for a big ass chain man, heavy thang
I never wear it though
That shits too loud like a pair of hoes
Coming through your stereo 'til I'm very old
There we go, every beat I rock is proper burial, no worries
Offensive lines, no sacks, no hurries
Lookin' out the window at the snow flurries
It all used to be so blurry
But now I see it clear
Thank you
Thank you for comin' out tonight
skrrt skrrt
I am the president of Dirty Money Records
skrrt skrrt
New York City
Who you know fresher than Nick? Riddle me that
Mami you itty bitty can't mirror me back
Everybody gon' see where I'm lyrically at
Used to hate Nicki, now they givin' me dap
I live and I learn, but I wait my turn
I'm always on the run, got weight to burn
Ease off the gas, then I make a turn
Three off the pas, they don't play like her
Why I can't just be ill?
Why when they see me, bitches gotta to go ""Ew""?
Why my lil' nigga, still gotta sell krills?
Why I'm this hot and still didn't get a deal?
The rain and the pain, I done paid my dues
I'm ready for the game, I done laced my shoes
Everything I say believe I'm gon' do
Came out the coop, Petite Vuitton boots
Can I get an encore I know you want more
I know you sick of all them girls, they such a bore
But it's my time I need you to roar
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
skrrt skrrt
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
You're far too kind
Now, can I get an encore? Do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
skrrt skrrt
Now what the hell are you waiting for?
skrrt skrrt
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise!
Who you know fresher than Hov? Riddle me that
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Yeah, hearin' me rap is like hearin' G Rap in his prime
I'm Young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country, but the blueberry still connect
On the low, but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect?! Yep, yep
Grand opening, grand closing
Goddamn, your man Hov cracked the can open again
Who you gonna find doper than him?
With no pen, just draw off inspiration
Soon you gonna see you can't replace him
With cheap imitations for this generation
Look what you made me do! Look what I made for you!
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you?
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits; look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
Kanye
So, I'm just an old dude, but I gotta tell you that I was energized by your performance and inspired by your hard work, but the biggest compliment I can give out to anybody is that you have created something I have NEVER seen before. I gave it a name, 'PERFORMANCE DESIGNER'. Art is a worthy pursuit but I think 'design' is an even higher form of creativity. Design 'fuses' art and science, or art and problem solving, or art and usefulness, sometimes all the above in the same project. I've seen lots of really good musical artists and been around really crazy good design work, but I can't think of anybody who has combined it to such a high degree as you
Thanks for the experience
skrrt skrrt
You send things out on Twitter and sometimes, like Kim has said -- and I'll tell you this also, I don't know if she's told you this along with not wanting more children -- but Kim has said…
skrrt skrrt
I'm fine to just practice.
skrrt skrrt
That's all you get to do. Kim said there should be a board of directors that goes through your tweets. Like, when you have an idea you give them to Kim and a bunch of people and they go, ""Okay, you can tweet that"" or ""No, you cannot tweet that."" Do you think you should have a board of directors?
skrrt skrrt
Absolutely not.
skrrt skrrt
No?
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Everything you tweet, you think – have you regretted anything you've tweeted?
skrrt skrrt
Nope.
skrrt skrrt
Nothing, never? You don't go, ""Maybe I should have thought about that a little longer""?
skrrt skrrt
What's the point of thinking?
skrrt skrrt
""What's the point of thinking…"" well, sometimes I understand, but sometimes there is a point to thinking. And then you tweeted out that you want Mark Zuckerberg to give you $53 million. In hindsight, should of that have gone on Facebook?
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I could of put that on Facebook, now I understand why he didn't hit me back.
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I understand that Zuckerberg doesn't use Twitter.
Ayo CyHi what the fuck bro?
We've been waiting for your damn album for years man
What the fuck is Kanye doing
How about you get the fuck up and get something done
Drop that shit
If I were you I'd stop being a little bitch
Grab an AK, load that shit up, get out there and drag Kanye's ass out
skrrt skrrt
Shake me down, not a lot of people left around
Who knows now, softly laying on the ground
Hey Ye, do you know what it feel like
To really be signed to you in real life?
Have you ever wrote a song
And you know you about to say something wrong but you still right?
I hope when I'm done that we still tight
But why wasn't I on the cover of the Complex?
You must've seen what I did to Funk Flex
Ya Sean my nigga but I'm coming after Sean next
Sit the fuck down Mr. West, I ain't done yet
While you're in your little Lambo on Sunset
I'm riding with a gun next to me
And it sounds like a little boy playing with a drum set
And it hold a hundred rounds
Cause when you come around niggas quick to gun you down
You'll be found on the other side of town somewhere, nigga
(Softly laying on the ground)
Get the fuck up
In my life I have seen people walk into the sea
Just to find memories plagued by constant misery
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
All day long man, we back ya down
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
So when a hooker choose Cons, she tellin you ""Bye""
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
And where the Glocks don't jam, so where we pop them scrams 
See I showed you on ""The Champions"" how we get down 
skrrt skrrt

Straight from the South Side of them Chi-Town streets 
skrrt skrrt

And if you talk about him, ayo I take you out 
skrrt skrrt
And let that dime gettin' friendly than the orgie's at eight 
But y'all niggas don't shine so you couldn't relate

You starin at my rose gold way too long 
You got to

skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
All day long man, we back in town
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
So won't you hook a chew scorns, she tellin you buy
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Aiiyo my name is Kanyeezy from the Roc-A fam
And where the Glocks don't jam, so where we pop them scrams
See I showed you on the champions how we get down
So don't twist ya lips, I'm like Bobby Brown
You got B2K on all your bedroom wall
But if you be with Kan, gonna work ya walls
Straight from the South side of dem Chi-town streets
The top three in the game, with these here beats
skrrt skrrt
And if you talk about him, aiiyo I take you out
Either with the nine or the tech's in his mouth
And let that dime gettin friendly than the orgie's at eight
But y'all niggas don't shine so you couldn't relate
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (You couldn't relate)
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Yo Quence, you couldn't relate)
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Quence without the game, now he's back to ball
Drive you insane, drop a tat at the mall
You starin at my Rolls' cold way to long
But I ain't scared of robbers, why I wear tephlon
I took her on the ave and she expect me to trip
But I made up with no style while I bought me some kicks
I got a big ego, (hahaha)
I’m such a big ego, (uhuhuh)
I got a big, (eheheh), ego
She love my big, (eheheh), Ego
She stroke my big, (eheheh), Ego
I like to joke around a little bit but here we go
Welcome to the wonderful world
Of gold-plated Earl, cause
Everything I throw up, blow up
Talking to the girl
She said, ""Know what, grow up, you nasty,""
""I don’t understand why they trippin’, if you ask me,""
Flow is just the nicest
I admit the propane
I just spit, probably
Just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club
Try and get as fresh as me
What you want dog
Trying to stay recession free
And spit, refreshingly
When I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty
You should bring a extra tee
Now I’m standing next to Jay
Who standing next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world
But you’re here with me
That’s good for my ego
Me and my ego
And it go wherever we go
My ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imagining
I had dreams of the league
One day I play Kobe
I walk up to Puff and he already know me
Coulda let the dream killers, kill my self esteem
Or use the arrogance as a steam that power my dreams
And my ego
Oh, baby, how you doing?
You know I'm-a cut right to the chase, huh
Some women were made
But me, myself
I like to think that I was created
For a special purpose
You know?
What's more special than you?
You feel me?
It's on--baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky; that's a big deal
Why?
Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gon' need it
I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie
It's too big (big)
It's too wide (wide)
It's too strong (strong)
It won't fit (fit)
It's too much (much)
It's too tough (tough)
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego
Such a huge ego
I love his big ego
It's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up
Usually I'm humble
Right now I don't choose
You can leave with me
Or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant
I call it confident
You decide when you find

Say u never saw dis coming well u are not alone
Woke up on the Microphone
Rhymes on my phone
Woke up
Past mom's time
That's a crime
I heard they sueing everybody
With commited crime
I was praying everyday
Then I saw the sign
I don't care what they say
Baby you're mine
Got new girls on me
But got six bucks only
Gotta hustle everyday
Gotta keep it groovy
They tried to put
My dreams in juvy
But my life is a movie
skrrt skrrt
So Waves don't die

Waves Don't Die Baby
No no no no no no no no
And you were always mine

Verse 2
Momma sent me back home
The flight was 30 hours
In my city it's all broke
We got falling twin towers
But we know God got us
We believe in Holy powers
skrrt skrrt
I got a dirty mind I got filthy ways
I’m tryna bathe my ape in your Milky Way
I’m a legend I'm irreverent I be reverend
I’ll be so faaaaa-ar up
We don't give a fuuuh-uh-uck
Welcome to the danger zone
Step into the fantasy
You are not invited to the other side of sanity
They callin' me an alien a big headed astronaut
Maybe it's because yo boy Yeezy get ass a lot
You’re so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil
Could you be an angel
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
They say be afraid
You’re not like the others
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
They don’t understand you
[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]

You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
They say, ""Be afraid
You're not like the others.""
skrrt skrrt

[Drake:]
What you mean I ain't call you?
I hit you when I landed
skrrt skrrt
Seems like we are arguing more and it's getting less romantic
skrrt skrrt
But I fucked you right, I will
I fucked you right I will
I'll fuck you like no one has ever ever made you feel
I mean this part of our relationship's amazing still
I might just put up with the arguing and stay for real
You looking bad, girl for goodness sakes
You with all those curves and me without no breaks
Ooh, I'm willing to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days well girl that makes two of us
Our timing is wrong
skrrt skrrt
Yeah, but tell them bitches that you'll always be my Mrs
And the hardest part about the fucking business is minding your own
Uhh, and everytime I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired then I break you off
It's useless all this fighting lets get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces you just send it back around
[T.I.:]
Your wrist and fingers glisten
Ice cold like Michigan
Eh look at what we living in
Here we go with this again
I just keep on talking but I guess that you ain't listening
Rather run around with them nothing ass bitches
Then, go on, got me hot, smoking like a chimney
We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemy's
Deep inside it's killing me
But soon its gonna be killing you
To see her in that two seater, now that's gonna hurt your feelin's boo
Ah ha, didn't you think you would be over me
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Into the wind, again again and deuces I must throw ya peace
skrrt skrrt
You know what, yo?
You a bitch!
You should have a travel agent cause you a trip
skrrt skrrt
But all you got is some fucking issues you fucking bitch
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Get your mind right baby or get your shit together
You gonna be hot a little while
I'mma be rich forever
Girl seducers, they come in Deuces
When I cut em off they always become a nuisance
skrrt skrrt
He just took my old bitch and turn it to his new bitch
Hehe. I'm stupid
But I won't get my drama on
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
So when you talk bout “you know who” I don't know who you talkin' bout
[Fabolous:]
According to my old bitch I be on some new shit
She was on some old shit, now I got a new bitch

Love is not a mystery, it's everything
skrrt skrrt
She was the type to watch Oprah and the Today Show
Be on the treadmill, uh, like OK Go
Had a body, A body that you can't pay fo'
That mean she had some Ds on her but they wasn't fake though
Had a drive for a drive for Rodeo
She spent pesos on those labels
Spin class at the gym, strip tease on a pole
She was so obsessed with her body and clothes
To every party she goes, tryin hard to be chose
They say it's hard for a pimp but extra hard for these (hoes)
Readin Us and People mag, tryna get the scoop
Chasin a actor for a Bentley Coupe
She been through the ball player from the Clippers, then came the pumps off
All thinkin she number one where she was just a jumpoff
Doin all she can for a man and a baby
Drivin herself crazy like the astronaut lady
skrrt skrrt
He had paper since we was in we was in high school
Pop was a doc, mom taught at my school
Lock with the rocks, in his ears he kept jewels

Ridin' in the lowrider, we got everything we want
Yeah we made it, these hoes wanna go with us
They see what we got
Fucked that bitch passed her to my homie
But wait this shit is a slow vibe let me feel it
""You never know, homie, might need some hoes, homie""
That's what I said to my homie when he had a hard time
Yeah, 'cause we..

Drive slow, Kanye, don't ever play yourself
Driving slow with all of the lights out
Only a teen, so I ain't taking pints out
Four in the morning, raves on at nights out
I'm a genius, so you better call Arab Attack
Stopped making songs for a while, but now I'm back
With Game and the newb on this track
I'll admit I suck at rapping so stop giving me flack
You know, I like to drive slow
When I'm out on parole
Creepin', making bitches scream
And climb up the fucking light pole
Otherwise, there's the highly likely sized
Chance that I'm flying at 190 down I-85
Too hot, I melt iron

My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TV's in here than where I live
And that don't make no sense, but baby I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's something serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics, baby this evidence
You see a player flicking and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, just a lil bit
I wearing my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canary's is gleaming through my angel wings
They see me, hoes acting like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smoking on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm riding on Vogues
My cylinder quiet like tip-toes
I sold O's and this I know
When you see them hoes, lil homie, drive slow
(Tony Williams harmony ad-libs)

My homie Marty used to stay, Sunny 9th and May
skrrt skrrt
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of stones
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand, keys in his hand
Reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked the leases, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How he get the cash the day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' somethin, 16 he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lakeshore girls, go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout 80
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
skrrt skrrt
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
They had they Lakers and our Royals, we was hurtin 'em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin' involved, but Dawg
Fuck all that flirtin' I'm tryin' to get in some drawers, so
Put me on with these hoes homey
He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow homey
Drive slow homey...
Drive slow
You never know homey, about these hoes homey

What it do; I'm posted up in the parkin lot, my trunk wavin'
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazin'
Them elbows pokin wide on that candy 'llac
Trunk open, screens on, neon's lit with 5th relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime pieces and sexy ladies
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fo's crawlin, you see them screens fallin'
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leanin' on the switch, sittin crooked in my slab

Man I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, nigga you ain't up on this
That's why I'm iced out, medallion heavy on the wrist
My niggas servin' the checks like the first and fifth-teenth
So insecurr, cut that coke 'til it's so unpure
We all need furs by December the third
Cause you heard, Chicago winters is extra burr
Bricks, nicks, nigga so herb
Hustlin' to the whole world, never sober
Seats in the Rover, soft as sofurrs
Ballin so hurr 'till I need a chauffeur
Man I promise, she's so self-conscious
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt

Now, tell me that ain't insecurr

[Produced by Darhyl Camper, Dave Tozer, John Legend & Kanye West]
Baby it seems the time is never right
You're goin' left and I'm goin' right
Its crazy
But I'm still waiting
[Prehook]
If I play my cards right
My lucks gonna strike
Until then there's a night
All I wanna do
Is dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Like lovers do
And it might come true

Song: DreamKillers
Typed by: BIGC888@aol.com
They gossipin, it runs the city, they don't know who watchin them
When they comin to get me, so I hit the block and bend
Do about 60, and I put my glocks to them, like blaow blaow blaow
Im finna to get on this TV and put shit down
I aint finna let these lights skinned niggaz come back in style
Im finna turn to this class clown, shit to crazy g's
They told my momma I was bipolar had A.D.D.
I told em, w-what I wanna do, I wanna be a baller
The dream spoilers'll fool ya
Hatin on you to they mans on the corners
Old folks said he'd never make it off the corner
They are the virus that corrupts the soul
They are the cubic zirconia inside the 10 karat gold
That get green on ya, when you get green on em
You gotta wash ya hands of em, get clean on em
Somebody told success is the best revenge
So they gon be fucked up when you do ya thing on em
Now hold ya plaques high, like who woulda thought
And tell em *ahem ahem ahem*, thank you for your no support
They are the dreamkillers, they the dreamkillers
Who know a dream, uh they are the dream (killer Norman Bates)
They the dreamkillers, they the dreamkillers
Dream, they are the dream (killer Norman Bates)
Now how you gonna talk about the way I spend my money
Everybody say it with me now, it's my money
And they know they hatin, but what they don't know is
They are my motivation, they are my inspiration
I'm to blame, I'll take the blame
I double guarantee that I will not complain
Just admire light the flame that got heated out
Burn up in a fire
Gotta get you back, girl you're that
One that takes me higher, I'm
skrrt skrrt
Stop, I'm your lover, baby
skrrt skrrt
It's hot under covers, baby

Prof. Nick Cave: Kanye, you join us today to be recognized for your transformative, genre-defining work across music, performance, film, and fashion design. Your visionary and ambitious career is a true reflection of the creative spirit. So, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Board of Governors of the School of the Arts Institute of Chicago and the Board of Trustees of the Art Institute of Chicago, I now confer upon you the degree of Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts, Dr. West
Dr. Kanye West: I'm sorry, that was just my opinion
I am a pop artist. So, my medium is public opinion and the world is my canvas
“I'm sorry” is something that you can use a lot. It gives you the opportunity to give your opinion, apologize for it, and give your opinion again. People say you should not be sorry for your opinions. George Bush… has some very cool self-portraits. I didn't know he was an artist
My style stays on point like spraypaint on eight trains
Try to picture that shit and it'll blow you out the frame
Now c'mon, my rap skills are beyond
Verbals make niggas fold like futons
When they try to switch styles and get convertible
I loosen up screws so that their joints ain't workable
My tongue is a drill on a mission to kill
Sabotage all those who [?]
And fake like they're kings, they're just peasants
Tempted like Christ meetin' the devil in the desert
Repentin' for their mortal sins
Tryna fuck around with Grav when they couldn't win
Yo check my lyrical microphones
Just like [?] speaker cones
See when a nigga spends time in the lab
It works fast so we givin' others jet lag
That's how me and my team keep catchin' [?]
And expand like bands on a soloflex
So what all these bitch niggas want?
Ain't no need for Grav to ever front, yo forever like this
R.I.P my nigga Von man
Straight up!
Came a long way from no flames
On the stove top
Robert Taylor days showed me
What'll make the spot hot
Can't be having feins lined up
Tryna cop rocks
Taking up yo whole porch
At yo door from six o'clock
Open up a candy store to justify
That trafficking
Can't just be letting errrbody
Know you got it fam
Peep game but don't let em
See game
If you ain't tryna spark flames
Don't come with the propane
Love the people in yo hood
Show em that the struggle good
Protect em from harms path
Show em, feel em real love
Money coming in pay they rent
For a couple months
When you see em slippin
And they living gettin a little rough
Shit get tough
Try to keep the crumb snatchers
Eyes blind to the nines, homicides
Baggin up them dub and dimes
Dishin nem assists out
Point guard, starting five
Get it all off
Move it till you get them
Weary eyes, no teary eyes
Know the difference from yo
Brothers and yo Guys
Then when everything hit the
Fan you won't be surprised
When will killin
So we can survive
Become legalized?
Cause shots fired
Cops ain't gone arrive
Till he bleed and die
Why should I compete with guys
Flow already lethalized
So easy to see through lies
When you got that see through eye
See dat bullshit from a far
Grateful for my eagle eye
Everything that's in the dark
Always slip into the light
Member that
Old honda or the lac
Hunnid dollas, Hunnid racks
Won't feel different that's a fact
That's gone be the end of that
It ain't always errrbody business

Killa! Baby!
Kanye this that 1970s Heron flow huh?
Yeah let's speed it up
Ayo street mergers I legislated
The nerve I never hated
On murders pre-meditated
Absurd! I hesitated
Observe: cock and spray
Hit you from a block away
Drinking sake on a Suzuki we in Osaka Bay
Playing soccer, stupid, stay in a sucker's place
Pluck ya ace, take ya girl, fuck her face
She dealing with Killa so you love her taste
She swallowing Killa cause she love the taste
I got brought up with crooking
Kitchen orders that I'm cooking
But got caught up with the jooks you woulda thought I was from Brooklyn
It gets boring just looking
Did like Bill Cosby, pouring in the pudding
Now the dashboard is wooden from a hard-tangled grammar
Interior, inferior, star-spangled banner
Car game bananas
My man Santana
Guns everywhere, like the car came with hammers
They trying to say he (down, down)
I hear niggas saying he (down, but not out)
But our flow is the truest
The games in the nooses
Our girls is the models
They coochies the juiciest
Yeah, they say he (down, down)
Yeah, they say he (down, but not out)
Cause I'm back on my grind
Money back on my mind
Ye' and Killa Cam', the world is mine
I treat bitches straight up, like Simon Says
Open vagina: put ya legs behind ya head
Mommas oldest, dads brightest
But youngin still thugging
What was it that bad guidance
Love him he's God gift
Though they hate I love it
It make me drive faster
They won't catch the F50 Ferrari
I got on Ferrari glasses
Mashing through New Orleans like it's Cali
I'm just trying to keep up with the fashions
Got my music blasting
Television splashing
I'm watching The Passion
Me I get my hot box game up when I flame up
Shame lil niggas at the red light change up
See everyone was around when I was down
Now it's lonely at the top since I came up
Look up, they trying to look me up and hook up look
I ain't got a nose for your boogers I'm sugar
That mean I'm good, if you is I'm gooder
Should of would of could of but you didn't cocksucker
This is that old south I'm talking with that old slang
Pushing that new thing, shitting on my old hoes
Pissing off my old homies
The game is fair but it's cold get your winter garmets
Still can't warm it
See I'm a break from the norm
My LA girls they say I'm so bomb, they eat tofu
The 40/40 on a special day
Them cheap niggas I'll still slide 500 to Desiree
Oooooh
(The Game)
That's Lloyd Bank's momma singin'
You betta tell your boy to keep his mouth closed
Or he gon' get a black tux
And a free wake
How my bow tie lookin'?
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
When I see Lloyd Banks it's goin', (down, down)
If you in the car wit em' you betta get, (down, oooh well)
Automatic rifle
And I'm blastin' on sight so
Ski mask, I'm psycho
My gun got night scope
Two in the leg knocked em, (down, down)
From Thirty feet away he fell, (down, oooh well)
Touch kids like Michael
One roll of the dice, oh!
You wanna gamble wit' your life
Nigga die slow
Now your casket goin', (down, down)
Tony Yayo tried to run
I chased him, (down, oooh well)
Cause' I hate the Jakes
Pat him down take his cake
He wanna be a clown nigga
Might as well paint his face
And that's how I get, (down, down)
Fuck G-Unit nigga I'm not (down, oooh well)
Used to ride wit' em'
Slice up the pie wit' em'
Got kicked out the group
Cause I wasn't gon' die wit' em'
And that's how it went, (down, down)
At Hot 97 we came, (down, oooh well)
Had Thirty niggas wit' me
Niggas that sport the Dickies
Hoppin' out of cabs
We just want to talk to 50
We wanna know what's goin' (down, down)
Security pulled heat it went, (down, oooh well)
Had to shake the block
I ain't tryna' face the cops
Heard a couple shots
Then I seen the shell cases drop
Told P-nut to get, (down, down)
I looked back and saw my nigga goin', (down, oooh well)
I said,""homie we can't leave em'""
What if my nigga dyin'
Soon as we hit Houston then
We heard police sirens
I appreciate everyone's support for my clothing line but I wanted to clarify a few things… The name of the line is Kanye West not DW… The DW was a design element placed on the invite in homage to my mom :-). I really appreciate the fake DW twitter page but since it's not official I can't co-sign any information on it
“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” – Leonardo Da Vinci
More clarity… I have no agency representing me currently… William Morris was fired after Cara Lewis quit. I love Cara Lewis :-)
I love being back at my fashion office learning and creating. It's so challenging and fun and I'm surrounded by amazing people. They say you only live once but every time I come to work I feel like I'm starting a second life. You guys might think I have some type of backing for my line but I don't. I did the first fashion show out of my own pocket and used the money I made touring to follow my passion. I've been working at this for 8 years now. From the first offers to do urban clothing lines that I turned down…to begging Bape to do my line and never making any real headway…to having an office in LA that was shut down after the “MTV” moment along with my tour with (Lady) Gaga
I moved to Japan for one month after that and designed every night in my room. I had this opportunity to intern at Fendi and was also offered a position at Versace which I could not take due to my contract with LV which was for 2 years. I moved to Rome after I left Japan and worked at Fendi for 4 months undercover. I was there to give ideas for the men's collection. I snuck to Giuseppe Zanotti's factory still under contract and learned to design womens shoes for 2 years before my first show in Paris. After doing the first LV collection I was sure I would get a second shot to create but was never given the opportunity
I designed a sneaker called the (Air) Yeezy with Nike. I'm “allowed” to design 1 pair of sneakers every 2 years. I have more ideas…
Early 2011 I moved to Paris and opened a small design studio. The language barrier was quite difficult. I still don't have a Paris VAT number to this day. I don't know what a VAT is but every time I asked why we didn't have fabrics they said it was because of the VAT. In Paris I met many great people in design including the master Azzedine Alaia. Azzedine even came by my studio one day :-). This was the greatest feeling to stand in his presence in my embarrassingly small Paris studio in a courtyard opposite Collate
I remember being 5 years old picking and my mother taking me with her shopping at the discount fur spots. She said I would always point to the most expensive furs, even as a child. LOL. There is something about making clothing that always brings me back to that point. For the first 16 or 17 years of my life the only thing I knew about women's clothing was what my Mom would wear. I guess some critics would joke that I still don't know anything. LOL. My Mom would wear blue jeans with a fur and an embellished “Cosby Show” sweater :-) to pick me up from school. The teachers said I couldn't focus. I used to get kicked out of class for bringing dirty magazines and drawing Nike's in 4th grade
Being a celebrity has afforded me many opportunities but has also boxed me in creatively. I was just discussing becoming the creative director for the Jetson movie and someone on the call yelled out, “you should do a Jetsons tour!”
This just happened a few hours ago. I was very insulted of course because for anyone that's seen the Watch the Throne Tour, Coachella, Glow in the Dark or Runaway know that I have real ideas
I appreciate having the most nominations at the Grammy's but I feel so conflicted by the fact that award shows sometimes are completely illogical. Good logic tells me “smile Kanye”, the world likes you again. “Red or blue pill?”…aaaaand Swallow. LOL. I wouldn't have the prestige I have if it wasn't partially for the Grammy's validation and I honor that
Hmmmmm, what to wear? Here I go again… Yeezy the trend setter or complete f*cking fashion victim…the verdict is still out. This is just a train of thought but I figure it's better to read than trained thoughts
What good is fame and prestige if you can't use it to help people? I want to help by doing what I know how to do best…create
I have started a new company and I'm so excited about the name…it's got the best name ever…of all companies…of all time!!!
The name of the company is DONDA
DONDA is a design company which will galvanize amazing thinkers and put them in a creative space to bounce there dreams and ideas. I used to blog all the time an fit was a way to get my opinion out. Dr Dre redesigned headphones and made more impact off of one product. I am assembling a team of architects, graphic designers, directors musicians, producers, A&Rs, writers, publicist, social media experts, app guys, managers, car designers, clothing designers, DJs, video game designers, publishers, tech guys, lawyers, bankers, nutritionists, doctors, scientists and teachers
DONDA will be comprised of over 22 divisions with a goal to make products and experiences that people want and can afford. I want to put creatives in a room together with like minds that are all way doper than me. We want to help simplify and aesthetically improve everything we see hear, touch, taste and feel. To dream of, create, advertise and produce products driven equally by emotional want and utilitarian need.. To marry our wants and needs…DONDA
This will all take time but I wanted everyone's to know what I really care about…I care about people…I care about my fans…I care about people who have never heard of me…There are over 7 billion people on the planet now…It's something about coming from music that makes me so optimistic. Music travels and is not limited to only the wealthy. Sometimes my grammar is wrong but my thinking is right :-). My mom was an English teacher so I know she sends an SMDH from heaven :-). 5:18 am in London, my dreams keep me woke

Even though I was a bitch playin hard to get
Cause see I never felt this way in my life
It didn't take long before you made me your wife
Shoppin sprees and puttin money in my pockets
Pictures of you inside my heart-shaped lockets
And my girls, knew you wasn't no good
They told me bout them broads you was fuckin in the hood
You said I was a diamond, and you was like a pearl
So daddy how could you do this to your baby girl?
Memories, is all it brings when I look at my rings
And ""Heartbreaker"" is the song I sing (c'mon, c'mon)

Breakfast in Paris, dinner in Milan
Sex on the beach, yeah we had it goin on
Then one day you hid my birth control pills
Said the way I sucked your dick it had you head over heels
When you got rich I helped you run your company
For eleven years, and now you wanna dump me?
And just to think, I was about to have a baby for you
And then some bitch you was fuckin said she was havin one too?
You wrong! Nigga dead wrong, you know the song
""Don't know what you've got til it's gone""
After the fight, the other night, and we both went to jail
I burnt all your clothes up, I was ""Waiting to Exhale""
(That's right)

Whatever you do

Spread you wings
Ariel...
(Verse 1 -- Lupe Fiasco)
Head to the sky
Wings raised and...
She's about to fly
And take her place in
I'm for in the stars
When she leaves the ground
She'll see a broken heart
If she turns around
But ain't no going back, this is how it must be
He told her she'll be burned alive, she just told him trust me
If funerals are beautiful, this ugly
Knowing this he told her you would leave me if you love me
And he knows that, because he knows her
Hard to hide his feelings, as it engulfs her
Now she's a bright blaze light rays

I hope you forget me not
Forget me not
I won't forget you ever, ever
Man I promise
After this remix
Forget Red Lobster
Cause I got reservations at Mr. Chow's tonight
And you can get any, and I mean anything that you want
Cause I'm about to bang 'em in the head with this paper

Don't forget 'em, Quence let's go get 'em
It wasn't until I got money, that I became a conscious rapper
Cause now I'm conscious of the fact of who they gon' go after
When they tryna find a back up for a team in the park
So they run up on my car before I can even park
But I guess there's no harm in hearin' out his proposal
But how you wanna stack and we aren't even social?
See this the kind of trash that if I choose to say no to
They gon' trash talk about me like a garbage disposal
And say that I changed like a dress rehearsal
And try to line me up with the intent to hurt you
But that ain't nuttin' more than a test of virtue
Cuz my promise to the hood is that I'll never desert you
For years I was swingin' at air
But then a wing and a prayer
Became the seats on the wing of a Lear
Yeah they kickin' theyself cause they should have stuck wit 'em
It's Cons to the Quence and you won't won't forget 'em uh

I'mma buy you a limo, and we gon' go to Red Lobster
And you can get all the.. all the lobster tail that you want
Cause I'ma be rich! Yeah I'ma be rich, uhh...
When you make that money boy they, say don't you forget 'em (x4)
Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em (x3)
Don't forget 'em, Cons don't forget 'em
I finally got my first real money
So should I turn Hollywood? I probably could
... and turn my back on the hood
And never go back, but I ain't with that
See this is where I learned to rap, and this is where I learned to scrap
And this is how I learned to stack
Penny by penny and bit by bit
Watchin the older heads move brick by brick
And one hand would wash the other, and one aunt would watch your brother
And your father wound up watchin your mother
And the prettiest smile you ever discovered
Becomes when you call her face
And your second cousin lost his case
They gave him 25-to-life, what a waste
And they tryin to pay your lawyer, but they just ignore ya
Spit it to ya say little West to little beast
To make the middle west blow like tha middle east
skrrt skrrt

So I had to cop the baby mama Benz
G
With put 50 I get this on the first tape
But that 50 break the bank
skrrt skrrt
Had a girl nicknamed Spreewell 
Cause when I try to stop she still made me spin
Back when 80's was in
My dog Crazy Ken had 80 of them
It's time to hit the dancefloor ya CRAZY again
Ya get that cash money like Baby and Slim
Pull up in somethin tinted
So tinted she squinted
She said ""This car is real old!"" I told her her it was vintage
And I need to hit the HEALTH CLUB
And get a girl thats
In to the fitness tryna get into the business
Ima make her my apprentice
skrrt skrrt
And let me get inside
Now I been hustlin' my whole life (Ohh)
Tryna get this money up (Ohh)
And I think I finally got it right
And I been partyin with this one girl
Who claim ""I gotta go to work tomorrow, but tonights the night
So pour another glass of that good stuff
A couple more shots and I'll be
[T.I. - talking]
Ay I'm working here, know what I'm saying
Try to put yourself in my shoes for a second
Its not personal I'm just sayin though
Ay look
From when the moon came out 'till the sun came up
I was supplyin' the days when where they flame up
Our mamas passing, by trying to explain us
Pissing in the bushes like they never house trained us
But, try to understand thats how we came up
You get to know us, you'll love us but you can't change us (naw)
Really we rather be rich and famous
But in the mean time were forced to slang dust
'Dro or crack cocaine, Penicillin to Rogaine
Ecstacy, Viagra, whatever'll get the dough mayne
I'm tired of people misrepresenting my domain
Oh you think we out here killing for nothing, hustling
For no gain (picture that)
Hey man I'm just doing my job
Hey lady, don't mind me I'm just doing my job
I don't wanna make your life more harder, I'm just doin my job
You live here, I work here I'm doing my job
I don't know if you don't know, don't care or can't see
Every time something up in the hood, it ain't me
And I ain't always up to no good and on the creep
There must be more good women than men percentage-wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
Thats why a lot of girls claim they arent into guys
And mess with other girls part time to improvise
I knew she wouldnt buy I see it right in her eyes
But Im like any other guy tryna get in her thighs
She tellin me bout how black people should enterprise
And Im like if you dont get your a-s in this ride from enterprise that I rented yesterday and gotta have in by 5
With the gas fully filled up like I didnt drive
I told her I had a girl but f--k it I didnt lie
This rap game is alright Im just gettin by
She had a little weed and we get a little high
And Im looking in her eyes
And Im loving her vibe
She told me back in 95 she fell in love with the tribe
Back in 92 I was just like you
Please dont be confused by the ice and jewels
Im like any other n---a my ice just stay cool
Like any other n---a that claim they hate school
And think yeah frees bangin but shes no Rachel

But you cant stand right here and tell me everythings is gonna be alright
Cuz until the day a real man stands up Im gonna have to improvise
Was it something I did wrong?
Yeah I know Im wrong
Shes at home alone and Im always gone
I hate it when shes mad but more when she passive
Now she on the internet looking for classes

Cats new it was a problem, went from robbin to rappin

When there's nothin left to eat, I ate away at my soul 
Felt destructive cause I don't give a fuck if I go

Killin other dogs got you cats chasin bitches 
Got me itchin to bring back the beast from within

For slips or falls
And I got paper to take you on trips to malls
Get you Prada till you fall
Till you tired of rockin it
Tiffani ain't cold till you tired of coppin it
Cold compressor, ma, I know you tired of droppin it
Here's the keys to the truck, cause they tired of watchin it
I know this world got all types of fools
Every whip with a stash box, for the fortunate have-nots
I know you said you can get me the six
With the deep dish buckets, but you know me, fuck it

I said ""we"" cause I'm here, you here!
Yeah, ride with me, your spot is reserved family
Cigarette boats, yachts, ain't nowhere we can't go
We in South Beach and the Hamptons, too, baby!
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt

You know why they call The Projects a project, because it's a project!
An experiment, we're in it, only as objects
And the object for us to explore our prospects
And sidestep cops on the way to the top - yes!
As kids we would daydream, sittin on our steps
Pointin at cars like yeah that's our sex
Hustlers profits made our eyes stretch
So on some Dr. Spock shit, we STARted our TREK
Some of us made it, most of us digressed
In the name of those who ain't made it, my progress
We show success, please live through me
See I'm the eyes for Emory, keep him alive
(This is a collect call) So everytime I press five
All he wanna hear is his boy talk fly
Up in the fed, and still holdin his head
So when he hits the streets he gon' eat through this bread
Now let's ride
skrrt skrrt
[Jay-Z - over Hook]
I'm crushin all award shows
MTV, BET, the Grammys, crushed linen, Purple Label
All that fly shit we talked about
Givin' em Sinatra pinky rings with the blue diamonds and e'rything
Hehehe, that's what we talked about right?
Uh-huh... tried to told you, ride with me
skrrt skrrt
International Hov', I told you so
40/40's out in Tokyo
Singapore, all this from singin songs
Comin up though we thought slingin raw
[Produced by Cid Rim and Theophilus London, Arranged by Kanye West]

skrrt skrrt
Man I feel like I'm on top of the world
Never heard him, I convert 'em, put my lovin' in 'em
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Baby I can take you from your girl
I was with my muse, Arizona
Sippin' on Arizona iced teas, homie
We havin' dinner at the MOMA
Oh this young pretty fly thing starin' at me
She kissin' girls cause she wanna
Deep down in her soul, man she fishin' for D
She send emojis to my phone
Now we in the black cab, turnt and gettin' trippy
I like all of her friends, they're some nice girls
She a runway tall model, pretty white girl
I never discriminate, just dated three black girls
That's my private life so you don't know that, girl
Indian, Russian, now I'm back in Milano
Where they feed me Italian cause I don't eat no McDonalds
All these girls be frontin', tryna be in disguise
On that hush, hush, hush, she tellin' you lies
Girl!
Distant lover, lover (lover, lover, lover)
Ooh, so many miles away
Heaven knows that I long for you
Every night, every night
And sometimes I yearn through the day
Distant lover (lover, lover)
You should think about me
Say a prayer for me
Please, please baby
Think about me sometimes
Think about me here, hey
Misery, misery
As I reminisce, ah baby
Through our joyful summer together
The promises we made
All the daily letters
Yeah, I keep it turned up to the max
Live every day like it's your last
Okay, okay, doing it for the streets
Dis morning, I woke up
Feeling like money, I jumped up
Put on my Guccis and my hat
Got my bag, got my strap
Gotta start rolling, I was thinking
'Bout Jacksons, Grants, and Ben Franklins
Only thing on my mind, getting dough
Getting dough, getting dough
Only thing on my mind is money, money, money
For some reason she just be calling my name
I guess it's all in the game
'Cause I always run get her, she a part of me, mane
I left the studio at seven, took a three hour nap
Ten o'clock flashed, I'm right back in the trap
I been addicted to the money for more than half my life
Let's do it!
Santana, Jim Jones, Killa, Freekey
How long we gon' have this shit on lock, man?
Yes sir, you gave me the right track Kanye
Listen, I been coppin them P's and
Maybe that's part of the reason
I feel like a boxer: bobbin and weavin
But I'm getting head
She's bobbin her weave and (yes sir)
I'm grabbin her neck to stop her from breathin
I'mma wild out until I part with my breathin
Until I'm sparked up and leakin
Part of the cement
I need something pure, like from the Garden of Eden (why?)
Wouldn't mind making her part of my achivements (what happened)
Cause when music discourage my pride (who was there?)
Zeke the only one with courage to ride
The ride's so dirty inside
Seems like we were playin in mud
Hazin' it up, grams, gauge and a snub
Who ill? a check for two mill
And a cheap case, defaced, blue steel, true skills
I got stories that my soul can sing
Flip water like Poland Spring
And I'mma hold them things
Look - talk to 'em
Look - my fella said you been coppin' a lot
Latest caper? Propellers on top of the drop
But fuck it, who ever thought I would rock at the Roc? (Killa!)
Top a top on top of the top
But yo - nothing definite
I chop up the rocks
And I stop up the drop
Blocka Blocka the block
Hello mate, yellow tape, helicopter your spot

Like Lieutenant Dan, I'm rolling
Back to back, I keep on smoking
Eyes keep shaking and I can't stay focused
I'm fucked if you niggas ain't noticed
I'm sweating, but I'm cold
Mouth all dry, but I got a runny nose
I just bought me a water bottle, chug that down
But I think I need me some more
And I keep feeling like I'm gon' faint
But fuck that, nigga, pass me that drank
I done drunk too much
I might throw up in a hotel bathroom sink
Bitch, I'm blown, I'm zooted
Can't believe that I'm even moving
Off a half a gram of molly, we about to go party
And I don't know what I'm doing
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Now all these rappers talking 'bout that molly
Bet a million dollars, these niggas ain't dipping
Pure MDMA, put it in a shot, we talking 'bout crystals
Been thizzing hard up all day
Rest in peace to Mac Dre
Throw up the T, scratch on my face
Do the Thizzle Dance up in the place
Now turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, now turn it up
Can't live my I, I can't live my
skrrt skrrt
I can't live my, can't live my
skrrt skrrt
Life this way, continually get high
Instead of runnin' round, lock one bird down
It's a new day, gotta do it big just to get by
Show no respect, can't live that way
Ya hold my check, can't live that way
With out my chick on deck, can't live that way
skrrt skrrt
My moves calculated through the lens almost here
skrrt skrrt
Man from Clint East to Kanye West
The sun can't chill but every day it sets
skrrt skrrt
This time I'm back on my grind
I know there's things in my life
That I'm a let go startin' tonight

My freak girl tell me now she a Christian
skrrt skrrt
I'm pullin' girls off the bench like a six man
I'm in the club doin' the same ol' two step
While Omega's doin' the same ol' Q step
I had my money on my mind I was thinkin' green
She a pledge A.K.A. she was pink and green
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I weren't really spittin' game I was scrimmagin'
My pimpin' ship so hard it needs censorship
[The-Dream]
I wanna see what's under therrrrrrrre...baby
skrrt skrrt
Who's that peekin in my window?
Uh, you should let some more skin show

We ain't even tryna settle, so why try?
skrrt skrrt

The way you bring your light into this room 
Uh, I love it, girl 
The way your legs ?light up? when they're in them shoes, ohhh 
skrrt skrrt
The way your lips looks after you apply the gloss 
Ah, I love it, girl, girl 
You look right in the screen then take it o-off, off 
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl 
(She's my digital) girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, GIRL, girl 
(She's my digital girl) 
skrrt skrrt
My homies never see you 
But I always got you right here for me 
Tucked, in my Louis computer bag 
[ Intro: The Dream]
Yeah, girl, you so sexy though
As she just lay at your feet
[ Verse 1: Kanye West]
I wanna see what's under there, there
Now put it in the air
Yeah, load it on my macbook air
It's a new form of macking, don't be old fashioned
Update your passion
Only reason why I be eye chattin'
Is when it's time for some action
I wanna hit it way, way out like John Paxton
But for now I just gotta watch her practice
Send her a picture so she see it
She says, I-I-I can't believe it
Ohh, she all on me, on me
Ohh, I think she want me, want me
I think she showed her homies
Why? Cause all the homies on me
Ayo, all the digital gonna have to do for now
But I'mma break it down when I get back in town
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt

The way your legs light up when they're in them shoes, oh
skrrt skrrt

You look right in the screen and take it off, off
See I can't wait till I get a little taste of you

Now your girl lookin' at you cause she didn't hell know
And now everybody sayin' that you did it before
And you know that's because they probably did it before
Cause if they did it before it would be different though
I wonder if Tammy knows, that I did it before
With Nisa, I wonder if she didn't hell know
That we did it before I know they did it before
The day we did it but oh, if they did it before
And we did it before, we can get it fa' sho
Cause if she with it, I know she should be with it fa' sho
I'm a tear that pussy up, like I didn't before
And after I did it they be history though
When I see em I act like I didn't hell know
That we did it before like we didn't before
But we did it before, hehe

You gotta act like you didn't before
And everytime I meet a girl
They say that she didn't before
Diamonds are forever...
They are... all I need to please me
They can... stimulate and tease me
They won't leave in the night,
have no fear that they might... desert me
skrrt skrrt
Diamonds are forever: Throw ya diamonds in the sky if ya feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever: The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever, ever ever, ever ever, ever ever, ever ever, ever ever, ever ever...
Good morning, this ain't Vietnam, still
people lose hands, legs, arms for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone,
and how it connects to the diamonds we own
When I speak of diamonds in this song,
I ain't talking bout the ones that be glowin',
I'm talking bout Rocafella, my home,
my chain, these ain't conflict diamonds, is they Jacob?
Don't lie to me man
See a part of me saying keep shining, how?
When I know of the blood diamonds,
Though it's thousands of miles away,
skrrt skrrt
Over here it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
skrrt skrrt
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets the charms's
I thought my Jesus piece was so harmless
till I seen a picture of a shorty armless
and here's the conflict - it's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend ya whole life trying to get that ice
On that polo rugby it look so nice,
how could something so wrong make me feel so right, right?
Before I beat myself up like Ike
You can still throw ya Rocafella diamond tonight

I'm a invade the thoughts you keepin baby
If your still not convinced I'll tell you more
skrrt skrrt
Uh Oh! I can be your wake up reason daily
You could be my first and leadin lady
I'm a make you happy that you waited, for me to settle down
Uh Oh! I'm ready and I'm not afraid to say it
I'm tired of the game already played it
I'm over all them other girls I dated
I'll tell you what you are
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt

Your the one that I quit the game for
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt

I can't explain just how much you shine
Give me your heart I'll give you mine
Poison Pen: Triple Optix. Yeah. Y'all fear this dude. Stronghold. Stronghold
Diabolic: Haha. Motherfucking Diabolic. Stronghold Mixtape Volume 2. It's a wrap for the game. It's over with. I told you, bitch. Come on. Poison Pen, what up? Breez Evahflowin', what up? C-Rayz Walz, what up? L.I.F.E. Long, what up? Mike the Terror. Come on. Stelf Index
You want to blam-blam, keep your hand balanced and pull it
Take your best shot or use your most talented bullet
Black talons and full clips. I could clap too
You couldn't catch a body if I threw somebody at you
I'm Strongholding, slap you ‘til my palm's swollen
Then cut your baby mom open like Ron Goldman
Traum rolled in green-tubed Garcia Vegas
I'm sharp as razors raised with a heartless nature
I don't care about airing out your parents' house
‘Til blood splatters on your mom's Donna Karan blouse
It seems apparent now. If I'm staring at you
You'd better fall back like someone's there to catch you
I love it though
I love it though, y'know?
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sinsation
I know I’m preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation
May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour I seen good Christians
Make rash decisions, oh she do it
What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it
She putting on her make up, she casually allure
Text message break ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it’s rubbing off
Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
I’m looking at her like this what you really wanted, huh?
Why we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime
When the sun go down it's the magic hour
And outta all the colors that'll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don’t leave while you're hot that’s how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat
You see I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
All that bullshit's for the birds
You ain't nothin' but a vulture
Always hopin' for the worst
Waiting for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need
She knows just what I mean
When I tell her keep it drama free
Chuckin' up them (deuces)
I told you that I'm leavin' (deuces)
I know you're mad, but so what?
I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finna throw them deuces up
What you mean I ain't call you? I hit you when I landed
skrrt skrrt
Seems like we're arguing more and it's getting less romantic
skrrt skrrt
But I'll fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
I'll fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean, this part of our relationship's amazing still
I might just put up with the arguing and stay, for real
You looking bad, girl, for goodness sakes!
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh
I'm willing to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days
Well, girl, that makes two of us; our timing is wrong
skrrt skrrt
Yeah, but tell them bitches that you'll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fucking business
Is minding your own
And every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired, then I break you off
It's useless, all this fighting, let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around
Your wrist and fingers glisten; ice cold, like Michigan
Look at what we livin' in, here we go with this again
I just keep on talkin', but I guess that you ain't listenin'
Rather run around with them nothing-ass bitches then
Go on, got me hot, smokin' like a chimney
We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemies
Deep inside it's killing me, but soon its gon' be killing you
To see her in that two-seater
Now that's gon' hurt your feelings, boo
Ah ha, didn't you think you would be over me?
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Into the wind, again, again, and deuces I must throw ya, peace
You know what, yo? You a bitch
You should have a travel agent, ‘cause you a trip
skrrt skrrt
But all you got is some fucking issues, you fucking bitch!
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Get your mind right, baby, or get your shit together
You gonna be hot a little while, I'ma be rich forever
Girl seducers, they come in deuces
But when I cut 'em off they always become a nuisance
skrrt skrrt
He just took my old bitch and turned it to his new bitch

Alright I think you ready this time

Bang bang, you hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang... I used to shoot you down

skrrt skrrt
Heads to them Katrina victims, we still mobbin
skrrt skrrt
AK on the backseat, baby it's so vivrant
Watch me let it spray like a hydrant, can't dodge it
You not gettin' wet in the rain is not logic
She won't give that pussy to Wayne, I'm so obliged just
Live and direct from inside of ya bitch body
And, hi there ho what do ya know I'm ridin'
In the same streets my pops died in, I got 'em and
I get that money tell my momma I'm grindin'
[Produced by Noah ""40"" Shebib & Kanye West]
skrrt skrrt
Ayo it's death before dishonor
You fuck with me or my family then I'm pullin' out a Llama
The only way I can keep calm is a strain of marijuana
I send you to the zombie walk, I'm a savage, just not a desiigner
I may have suicidal thoughts, you know this shit's depressin'
What comes around goes around, out of my Smith & Wesson
My role models are Don Vito Corleone and Al Capone
Minus the Syphilis, but you know this shit infectious
Even when I'm in the zone, there's only so many sins I can atone
That when I make it to the afterlife, hell's my place, no side steppin'
Coke deals and guns, that's how I get my money for my kid's college
So they don't stoop down to my level, want them to get some knowledge
Two strikes on a criminal record, there ain't no way to get a job
So we have to do what we need to do feed the fam, which is kill and rob
If you try to dishonor me, then you will perish
After Once Upon a Time, no more mafia, there will be just Erik

Uh.. killa.. Dip Set.. Santana.. Freeky.. Jim Jones
Yo, yo, yo the way I been treated in this industry? Not nicely
Little faggot motherfucker like {*Mike Lighty*}
Tried to get someone to pop my chain
Getting robbed dog, is not my game
My nigga hopped out the van real quick, cocked that thang
Reversed the situation, popped his chain
Be happy we ain't pop his brain
Aiyoo, I treat that show money, Mike..
Like it's coke money, aight?
So you better have it, consequence could be a casket
I'm beyond forensic, a menace wit' a matic
I'mma leave 'em in the streets just splattered
Beat and battered, fuck cops, police don't matter
Bring 'em to me
(Chorus 5x)
[Jim Jones talking over Hook]
Triple noooooo, Come on, Bs Up, Dip Set, uh
Yo, aiyyo I pop to my name
With not a dollar, not a cent, not a rock to my name
Yo I'mma keep it funky dog to hop my chain
For a block and cocaine, now it's back to my block and cocaine

Oh, oh, oh

Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
That's me, the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
""You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?""
(You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)

Welcome to D12 World!
Prostitutes and guns, so fuck the real world
[Bizarre]
Fuck the silly shit, I pull a mac milli quick
When D12 rock his summer it's over with
All these bitches and all these hoes
What the fuck you looking at me for? (You, nigga!)
Oh yeah, you like my chain
Want to get your skinny ass up in the Range
I like my bitches raspy and nasty
I like a fat and nasty bitch named Ashley
[Swift]
I slide you dope without no procrastination
And you can watch me fuck up your imagination
I'm always getting drunk, and I fiend to smack hoes
I mean it, I leave them screaming like pterodactyls
This is our world
[Kuniva]
We'd love to smack you
Hot lead flying with debris and schrapnel
Ripping you to shreds, fucking up your tattoo
Break into your crib, take your records and plaques too
[Kon Artis]
D12 is, that's who! Got you limping
Still popping something purple with a bottle of gin, bitch!
I fuck up your kinship, I lie in this shit
Peep, I stole your mom's jeep and crashed into my street

(Na na na na, hey hey hey, goodbye)
Only rapper to rewrite history without a pen
No I.D. on the track let the story begin, begin, begin
This is anti-auto-tune, death of the ringtone
This ain't for iTunes, this ain't for sing-alongs
This is Sinatra at the opera, bring a blonde
Preferably with a fat ass who can sing a song
Wrong, this ain't politically correct
This might offend my political connects
My raps don't have melodies
This should make niggas wan' go and commit felonies
Get your chain tooken
I may do it myself, I'm so Brooklyn!
I know we facing a recession
But the music y'all making gon' make it the Great Depression
All y'all lack aggression
Put your skirt back down, grow a set men
Nigga this shit violent
This is death of auto-tune, moment of silence
La da da da da da
Hey hey goodbye
Hold up
This ain't a number one record
This is practically assault with a deadly weapon
I made this just for Flex and
Mister Cee I want niggas to feel threatened

Back (back) to the heavens I fell from
My father named me Cydel
My momma pushed out a diamond
Took out the del off my name and put the H-I behind it
That's CY-HI short for your HIghness
Then I added The Prynce
So you know where my mind is
My sister asked me when I'm goin' to get married
When it's affordable to get my wife six carats
Supposed to have a brother but my mother had a miscarriage
So every blessing he was supposed to get i'll inherit
I really wanted to be an athlete
So, it's the Olympics every time me and the track meet
I'm so ahead of my time I'm finna lap me
I know the Lord is Thy Shepherd though I'm the black sheep
I ain't gotta act street you can ask V
It was nothing to get off of key
Like a wack beat
I hit the gas let the 'lac creep
My partner riding shotgun same thing was in the back seat
I ain't worried bout niggas sayin' I'm wack
Cuz when I was in the traps
Some niggas really tried to wack me
Ya don't really know the feeling
Prynce ain't from Queens
But I've seen supreme dope dealing
King pin shit in this ring there's no squealing
Disciplined gangsters no women no children
At the age of nineteen I had the coupe no ceiling
Selling fruit while I'm bumping number two Lord Willin
If I ever make a million
I don't want to lose it all; Curt Schillings
I got a homie who didn't deserve prison
Tried to tell him that the man he killed wasn't worth killing
But that's the life of a young goon
When it rains it pours caught in a monsoon
I'm hoping that his day come soon
Memories of us rapping beatin' on the table in the lunchroom
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt

(Lupe)
yeah
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
life styles of the rich and famous
bought a big house and a whole lot of ranges
a fresh new couch and a whole lot of trainers
a closset full of clothes and some brand new dangers
and some mexican floral arrangers
a great big tv that'll entertain us
some colourful commissions from some high paid painters
someone to take the rap so i stay stainless
a new relationship with a banker and
two pinky rings for my manicured fingers
a trained german shepard that barks when its angered
to watch my possesions and look out for strangers and
a 50ft yaht with an anchor a young super model who shall remain nameless
the ups and the downs
the sames and the changes
all the money in the world dont make it painless
but they love it and they love it

Nato per correre, non camminare
Vie da percorrere, lascio polvere lungo le strade
Faccia criminale
Vi lascio giudicare
Tanto non importa dove vieni e dove vuoi arrivare (Baby)
Che tu sia rumeno
O negro
O bandolero, marero
O che tu sia maruego
A loro non importa chi tu sia davvero
Importa quando saremo dentro e quanto ci staremo
Io sono stato dentro

And they think they know, and they think they know
skrrt skrrt
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, yo
I don't love who I am so I'm workin' on a fix
I don't need a bitch trying to take my mind off my grip
If I had one wish it'd be to have more wishes, duh
Fuck tryna make it rhyme, throw them stones, with your bitch ass
Cutting me deep and even though I bleed I stand alone
Monster how should I feel? Creatures lie here (Grand Hustle Homie) Looking through the window. Monster how should I feel? Creatures lie here, looking through the window
T.I.:
Went from the King of the South to the King of the States
Ridin in a car you probably never seen in the states
No idea how much yay I can bring in the states
Hey you can get a hundred on 'em for a million today
Frank Lucas ain't the only one who made a million a day
But it's a American gangsta right here in your face
And you don't wanna see P$C on the scene with a K
You think you runnin up and robbin, that ain't even the case
And just because you get away, that don't mean it's okay
You a dead man walkin and I mean it, okay? Gon' take that other couple mil' and put it back in the safe
Five cash for the crib on the back of the lake
I'm up in Crucial two-steppin with the gat in the waist
T.I. ain't in the street no mo', fo'-fo', is that what they say?
Don't even try him when you see him boy you have to be great Cause this pistol hit you in your face, your teeth they'll have to replace
Chorus: Monster how should I feel? Creatures Lie here, looking through the window. Monster how should I feel? Creature lie here (Stop) Looking through the window

How we stop the Black Panthers?

You hear that? What Gil Scott was ""Heron""
When our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack, raised the murder rate in D.C. and Maryland
We, invested in that, it's like we got Merrill Lynched
And we been hangin from the same tree, ever since
skrrt skrrt
So we, cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it
Sell it, the fiends, cop it, nowadays they can't tell if
That's that good shit, we ain't sure man
Put the CD on your tongue, yeah that's pure man
From the place where the father's gone, the mothers is hardly home
And the madigon's lock us up in the Audy Home
How the Mexicans say, we just tryin to party holmes
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt

Back in the hood it's a different type of chemical
Arm & Hammer baking soda raised they own quota
Right when our soldiers, ran for the stove cause
Cause, dreams of being Hova
Went from bein a broke man to bein a dopeman
To bein the President, look there's hope man
This that inspiration for the Moes and the Folks man

I got a mess that can't be mopped up
Chilling with my girl and guess who popped up
A chick from the road that says she's knocked up
Next thing I know your boy's locked up
Cause the one I rocked up is worse than upset
Wish I could take it back, reverse the blood test
Cause I was in the hood getting hooptie love
Till I hit the road and groupie love
Stacked all my paper got a crew with dubs
Now I'm the one that all the groupie's love
But how I'mma tell my secret to a pillow talker?
That's too caught up and she's still a stalker
My days are darker
Fate is altered
And me and baby girl ain't make the alter
But after all of that I done learned my lessons
Matter of fact, these are my confessions
[Kanye talking over the hook]
Yeah. Kanye To The...The Roc is in the building

Khaled, you a real nigga, you got the keys. But as we learn all the politics, and niggas was doing for years, Obama couldn't make America great, because he couldn't be him, to be who he was.
Black men have been slaves, Obama wasn't allowed to do this, *screech*, and still win. He had to be perfect, but being perfect don't always change shit bro. Being perfect don't always change shit bro.
So when I'm talking about MTV -- Let me explain something. I was hurt. Beyonce, I was hurt because I wanted to present a video called ""Famous"", and out of respect, MTV told me ""Mr. West, I don't respect you. I will let you know that Beyonce is winning the video tonight, for formation, over Hotline Bling and Famous."" They told me beforehand so I wouldn't run on stage. Ay bruh, y'all ain't gotta fuck with me, but you know I got the vision, and you know I'mma keep it real with you.
Beyonce, I was hurt, I went down 7 years on behalf of yo --
I have dreamed the dream of every common man
Ahh hoping to rise to the top
I have sworn by my blood as your man, my love
That one day, I promise one day your heartaches would stop
But I've never never never never changed
I never change one single grain of sand
Oh, thanks to you baby
For just loving a common man
I want to thank you this evening
Oh, I thought, I thought that I failed you so
But that's when you turned around and looked me in my eyes
And you let me know
You said, and you said it softly
I didn't have to worry about being a common man
You said, ""David, you don't have to worry about rising to the top""
You said, you said, you said I didn't have to swear by my blood
skrrt skrrt
I'm not saying this to shake you up (Saying)
I'm just saying this to wake you up (Saying)
It's all good when we're making love
All I'm asking is don't take our love
For granted, cause granted my love for you is real
If you don't love me, somebody else will
Baby girl don't you, ever, get too, comfortable
To the left, to the left
If you wanna leave, be my guest you can step
Feeling Irreplaceable listening to Beyoncé
Well, okay, I put you out on your B'day
Hey, now you be rocking with Weezy
Bedroom in the bank, baby, we safe
I got game like EA
But I wanna let you play
And don't I treat you like soufflé?
Don't I look at you like I see a new day?
And don't I do what I do say?
I'm through talking so I'mma let you 'Face
And let 'Ye do 'Ye
Yeah, let me catch my breath
Talking 'bout leaving, and you ain't gone yet
And if you leave, leave correct

Mouloud Achour: I always wondered, when we were talking with Jean, he was saying that it was hard for you to get into this ""fashion world"", and you were saying it was hard for Michael Jackson to put his videos on MTV. And I don't realise, how much a guy like you, that I listen to everyday, I watch everyday, and influences the use - everytime you do something, people wanna do it. So how is it possible that the big houses don't understand that?
What's the best form of genocide?
skrrt skrrt
Cause I guess it takes up less of they time
What's the best form, best, best form of genocide?
skrrt skrrt
Cause I guess it takes up less time
Now, if you can make the niggas kill the other niggas, go figure
If you can make the niggas kill the other niggas, go figure
Then we'll have more time to make real figures
And we can still keep it lookin' at them like
""Damn, look at those real niggas
With they chains and they cars, but they still niggas""
Cause soon as a nigga gets it
Then another nigga wants to get it
Soon as another nigga has a girl
Then another nigga wants to hit it, admit it
Soon as a nigga has a crib
They want to break into that nigga crib
See where he live, see what he did
And don't wanna do the same shit he did to get that crib
Get it? You know, when niggas is killin' niggas
What's amazin' to me
What don't phase me is when niggas try to call me crazy
Cause they don't phase me
Cause I don't give a fuck what people think
Cause people don't think
See, I don't give a fuck what people think
Cause people just don't think
Now picture this; now if I show up onto this motherfucker
And express myself creatively
They always want to say, ""He's crazy, see""
And when they so distressed
What would be the best thing to write?
How 'bout this: ""Kanye West wears a dress""?
Yes, now maybe that can take away from the way
I kick them niggas ass on 12/12/12
Maybe that can take away
Nah, nah, nigga, they seen it, these niggas seen it theyself
Well, and my grandfather ninety-seven
He said, ""I ain't never seen you get down like that""
He ain't give a fuck about the kilt, this dress
Whatever the fuck they call it
You see, niggas killin' niggas
You can't see through the fog
With all the negativity that they write on a blog
I give a fuck about what somebody think
If that person doesn't think
It's too early in the conversation anyway
You know, they say, ""You should be embarrassed
You should be embarrassed, you a nigga
How the fuck you gonna show your clothin' line in Paris?""
You should be embarrassed, you should be
Didn't you read the reviews, the press?
I don't give a fuck, I guess
I don't give a fuck, no, it's not that I don't give a fuck
It's that I give most of the fuck and I'm not givin' up
And it's not that I'm crazy, no, that's a lie
I'm not crazy, I'm just not satisfied
And I would die for what I believe in
When I see that, uh, just a change what y'all receivin'
Do you all receive us? Do y'all believe it? It's too much
Okay, there's someone they can't touch
How 'bout some integrity from your favorite celebrity?
That's me, that's me, niggas killin' niggas
""Why he do that? Why he wear that?

He never told, who we gon' tell, we top of the totem pole
[Produced by DJ Premier]
And now for my next number I'd like to return to the…

[Kanye West] Uh, uh, – timeless
[Kool G Rap] Live straight classic

[Kool G Rap] Live, straight classic
[Kanye West] Timeless
[Sample] I'd like to return to the classic
[Rakim] Kanye West
[Rakim Sample] I'm Rakim, the fiend of a microphone
Uh yeah, is y'all ready for 20-07? It's now another drought
Everybody's a killer, wow, we buggin' out
Since '86 showing the crowd what I'm about
And they still wanna know when the album coming out
Ask the teenagers, OG's and nasty kids
What their definition of ""classic"" is
Timeless, so age don't count in the booth
When your flow stay submerged in the fountain of youth
Ain't no doubting the truth, I'm off the meters
Everybody cosigning, even non-believers
Since I came in the door became one of y'alls leaders
In a fresh pair of Air Force One sneakers
Uptowns, we call 'em uppies when they're on divas
Probably worn when KRS-One teaches
Nas made you look before the heaters
I bet you Kan' had em on when he walked with Jesus
You can't buy this Superfly-ness, like a shine is
Your Highness is performing; look how long the line is
It's what happens when you make shit that's timeless
It's what happens, these rappers is the pioneers
skrrt skrrt
That's so novice, I'm so polished
I got a right to be a lil bit snobbish
I did a lil bit of college
Semesters, it took two, like Rob Base
To let me figure out this wasn't my place
The beat's slow, 'til you listen to my pace
‘Cause I be killing shit, but that's evident
And y'all feeling it, but I expected it
If it's classic, it's gon' last forever then
I'm everywhere you never been, and better than I ever been
Is y?all ready for Twenty-0-7, it?s now another drought
Everyone?s a killer, wow we buggin out
Since 86 showin the crowd what I?m about
And they still want to know when the album comin? out
Ask the teenagers, O?Gs and Ask the kids
What they definition of Classic is
Timeless, cause age don?t count in the booth
And your flow stays submerged in the fountain of youth
And no doubt the truth I?m off the meters
Everybody co-signing even non-believers
I came in the door, became one of y?alls leaders
In the fresh pair of Air Force One sneakers
Uptown we call ?em uppies when they on divas
Prolly worn when KRS One teaches
Nas, made you look, before the haters
I bet you Kan had ?em on when he walked with Jesus
This is classic
classic, better than I'v ever been
Talent,
If it?s classic it?s gonna last forever than I?m everywhere you never been and better than I ever been
Classic
Better than I'v ever been
skrrt skrrt
Can?t buy this, superflyness, like a shyness, your highness
It?s performin?, look how long the line is
That?s what happens when you make shit that?s timeless
That?s what happens these rappers is the pioneers

Got a surprise for you that ain't on your Christmas list-es
Gave her the hot chocolate, she said “It's D-ricious”
First, I wanted to say Merry Christmas to y'all
For Santa Claus, so bake a turkey, burn a few logs
I be there soon, on my sled, me and Rudolph
Thugs think I'm a Blood 'cause I won't take this red suit off
Ha, I swear I got the freshest wardrobe
I let my beard grow 'cause it's cold in the North Pole
Her voice slow 'cause “I always got a sore throat”
Okay, stop it, no more jokes
You never see me 'cause I shop when the stores close
And my sleigh go faster than the Porsche go
Ha, I got nine reindeers
That's Dancer, that's Prancer on the fourth flo'

Tell my family that I'm sorry that I gotta stay
I'm with Ye at the Macy Day parade
Letting the snow fall on my aviator shades
Even though I'm in New York I'm still repping for the A
On the stoop of that Brownstone shovelling the brownstone
Santa's on a diet, gotta get the pounds gone
Down town got me feeling like it's Dow Jones
But uptown got me feeling like its down home
Snow like sugar hill
Chains on wheels
We turn our two doors into snowmobiles
We got our own style, no Soho feel
Put on your play clothes, how that logo feel?
Oh, pose for them photo stills
You dont wanna miss a moment
Where's your NoDoz pills
I caught her looking at my Rollie as my mojo spills
Snowflakey on the bezel
Hope you know those real

And I’m, so happy I’m with my baby

Rushin’ for the mall, don’t trip, you know I drive crazy
skrrt skrrt
Told her that â€œYou the star at the top of my Christmas treeâ€

But I don't know why I keep calling (why I keep calling)
All of these girls at my shows they loving me
But I don't know why I keep calling
Why I keep calling you
All the models to the floor right now
I'm in my Christian Dior with a Veronica Webb 
Noemie Lenoir, Chanel, Sessilee Lopez 
Arlenis Sosa, Selita Ebanks 
Grew up on Mobb Deep, speak that Jourdan Dunn language 
Make a phone call, out to Joan Smalls 
I wonder how it feel to lower Stone's walls 
Jessica Gomes, y'all, I would damage her 
And see if Jessica Stam got the stamina 
I'm in the car with Leo and the Benz swerve 
I heard Bar was friends with Esti Ginzburg 
Coco Rocha, Kate Mimosa 
Alessandra Ambrosio, Anja Rubik 
Get Olga Kurylenko, tell her I'm very single 
Abbey Lee too, I'm a freak boo 
I'm wilding, I'm on a thousand 
I wanna see Irina Shayk next to Doutzen

[Bridge : Kanye West] 
Christian Dior denim flow 
I told her I'm trying to eat out
So what we going to dinner for? 
Miami nights on the search for some T and A 
Trying to hide what's obvious to see in me 
We conversate a bit about your DNA 
And my salmon-colored suits from the VMAs 
Oh, you was watching? Who the fuck wasn't? 
Me skip across that stage in 5 dozen EGGGHCK 
Yeah, six grand for a minute's time
Italian Vogue style a nigga for a minute rhyme 
Let's be clear and let's be fair
The best things in music's being offered here 
It's a round table full of bosses here 
Still giving you it all like the coffin's near 
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
So your brother's bound and gagged
And they've chained him to a chair
Won't you please come to Chicago just to sing?
In a land that's known as freedom
How can such a thing be fair?
Won't you please come to Chicago for the help that we can bring?
We can change the world
Rearrange the world
It's dying
To get better
Politicians, sit yourselves down
There's nothing for you here
Won't you please come to Chicago for a ride?
Don't ask Jack to help you
'Cause he'll turn the other ear
Won't you please come to Chicago or else join the other side?
(We can change) Yes, we can change the world
(Common) And ya say Chi-City
(Kanye West) We don't stop, naw, we don't quit
I rap with the passion of Christ, nigga cross me
Took it out of space and niggas thought they lost me
I'm back like a chiroprac' with b-boy survival rap
It ain't ninety-fo' Joe, we can't go back
The game need a makeover
My man retired, I'mma takeover
Tell these halftime niggas break's over
I'm raw, hustlas get your baking soda
Too many rape the culture
Leave rappers with careers and they faith over
It's a war goin' on, you can't fake bein' a soldier
In the basement, listening to tapes of Ultra-
Magnetic, to the fact the messiah is black
I'll turn the TV down, we can take it higher than that
I wonder if these whack niggas realize they whack
And they the reason that my people say they tired of rap
Inspired by black Muslims and Christians
Pushin' cutlasses, dope, and other traditions
In the conditions of the city, the city
The city, the city, the city, the city
skrrt skrrt
Uh, any chance I get I'm on a plane
I book advance tickets and pay the fees with no complaints
In the summer its off the hook no time to waste
Just lie at the lake and I'm shoulder dry to the taste
Even though some niggas I grew up with hate
I keep a few good homies that try to stay outta jail
Tonio tell me what the bail is it'll be there
And when you get out my coke tail here
The crack head deals in my daddy
And all he seem to dream about is bad ass habits
The gun shots scream loud
So I soak the radio from upstairs to outside the house
With the extended cord no night is boring
On the front porch even if its pouring
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Chi town, Chi town, the city where I'm from
As a kid to who I become live to get what I want
Chi town the city with the best skylines
skrrt skrrt
Chicago show'em how we do
The best place some hate but they still come through
Chi town the city with the best skyline
skrrt skrrt
The liquor store on every corner packed
The bus run twenty-fo and my stop Jackson
Fire hydrant busted time for action
Niggas come out like its the beach in Miami
The cops chase thiefs all through the alley and don't stop
These niggas kill for rocks
If you can't stand up for your spot don't squat
Shop for a vacant lot or get shot
Cuz Chicago niggas don't play them games
When it comes to slanging them thangs for the money mane
Fuck around and get short for the playas ball
And call don Juan to flash green on yall
The pimps got the hoes pinned up on the wall
Just pass me the blunt and I puff it all
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I told niggas I'm a hustler, it's like they keep on forgetting
36 mil in 8 months, you still think I'm bullshitting?
Catch me on top of Fortune's Hot 100
Head of G-Unit Enterprises, still getting blunted
Went from selling crack to rap, that's two different games
But they're parallel to each other, homie, so they're quite the same
You know that crack spot so hot, you better off playing the block
Fiends can't help but be fiends, they come and cop for the cops
Back in the pens again, penitentiary doors spin
The game full of heartbreaks, can I win for Christ sakes?
Ace after ace, Lady Luck just won't fuck with me
That's why I got this attitude, nigga don't say what up to me
I took something heart-pumping, move and I'll pop something
Cop bricks, break 'em down to pieces and prop something
Niggas stay in stunt mode so I stay strapped up
My body language saying ''fuck around and get clapped up''

Nothin' really just to Roc, me, Free and Mac Milli

I drove to New York with ten dollars to my name
Brought back a couple platinum plaques on a plane
Brought back the soul to change the game
Had a little beef I had to aim, it's stainless steel
The lyrics in my heart I can't restrain they real
I swear to God I wish I had a dollar bill
For every time a nigga told me stick to the beats
I could have ate at Cheesecake at least six times a week
Plus I'm killin' these niggas on that lyrical shit

They try to tell me my chain broke the levee 
Maybe cause it's flooded 
Why you walk around with a baby cross's cousin? 
My teeth already white, y'all gon' make me floss for nothing 
My teeth real diamonds , what's the cause of the fronting? 
Why y'all got all caps on? 
Don Cheadle time, get extra black on 'em 
Burn, Hollywood, burn! 
Take too long for niggas to get they turn 
Probably be cremated before I get my earn 
They try to tell me that aliens built the Pyramids 
I swear life's a bitch, on a period 
For every inch they cut the nose off the Sphinx
I make my jeweler add a few more links 
You can look at me tell I don't give a fuck what nobody think 
And my face always looking like somebody stinks

Alright, okay
skrrt skrrt
Like we should, like we should

Question: what color was the skin of the man who beared the cross? 
No matter how many lashes, they couldn't beat it off 
How many Cassius will we see in one lifetime?
That's why it's Miles Davis, Kobe, it's Mike time 
I keep that GOAT book on the ottoman 
And wrote hooks about slaves that was slaughtered in the 1800s 
Y'all forget that I got called ""nigga""
On Twitter so many times, yo, I lived that 
Now I'm just tryna find where to raise my kids at
Cause they don't want niggas next to where they crib at 
Hey realtor, I'm lookin' for a nice park
Twelve noon, she said my family gon' make it too dark 
This is the flow that solar eclipses
You know I keep my eyes wide
East side high risers
West side low riders
Vest with the four-fire
Yes I fo sho fire
D-I-P low rider
See police, slow the ride
See scwalay , nigga
Cause they be thinking that the ride stolen
Keep your head up and your eyes open
Load the lead up while the ride rollin
Creep up on a motha like what you say fucka
Well fuck him and if he live smoke him
We don't appeal to the law
You know we ride this motherfucker till them wheels fall off
And the first bastard get fly
You know blad, blad, blad, was my reply
89 wolf pack and we wylin
P-89 pull gats cause we violent, shit, yea
We put coke on the strip
Don't quote me boy cause I ain't said shit
Since I made a gang of bucks
Nah I ain't been hanging much
Still slide through fly coupes, and the chains is plush
Keep the banger tucked 'case I had to bang a fuck
skrrt skrrt
All day we hanging smut, dog with a gang of ducks
Hundred grand on the hand, Game got the range of trucks
Kill wit the deal, still got cane to cut

The lasers on Glocks
Razor oxes

Pump the base on the Pac

The problem I have with the paparazzi is if they're right in front of you and you're like, “Can you please not take a picture of me?” And they're like, “Dude I'm not really taking a picture,” and they just keep on doing it like they're talking to me like I'm stupid and stuff, and then, with arm sprints, I'm going to grab the camera, that just happens, and you don't expect that to happen with a celebrity, cause you think they're like a museum animal and stuff, but it's like, don't shoot the animals, then, maybe, I don't know.
[Conan O'Brien]
What's interesting, though, the problem is that once you do something like that, the word's out. And these guys know that a shot of you losing your temper is worth ten times more then a shot of you remaining calm. So it's kind of a no-win situation a little bit.
Yeah, you know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches!
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that I grab yo ass
Why you actin' all
Shy and all
Why is y'all
Lyin' for?
""I never did this before""
Stop that
What, you want some patron?
I got that
I mean I promise y'all
You fine and all
And your girlfriend, she kinda raw
But she not like you
No, she not like you
Right now I need you to mute all the monologue
All that talking is goin' give me a Tylenol
You put a nigga to sleep, I'm tired of y'all
Right now the Louis Vuitton don is signing off
But, I just thought you should know
We hit the liquor store
Got some Cris and some Mo
And we about to let it flow
Had some problems before but see we let em go
Got an ounce of that dro
And we about to let it blow
Girl, you know I love you
No matter what you do
And I hope you understand me
Every word I say is true, cause I love you'
Baby, I'm thinkin' of you
Tryin' to be more of a man for you
And I don't have much of riches
But we gonna see it through, cause I love you
Some men need lots of women
For their passions to fill
But I want only you, girl
If it's in, if it's in, if it's in Lord's will, cause I, cause I love you
I, I, I love you, baby
With all my heart and soul, oh, oh, oh
I love you
skrrt skrrt
I want you
skrrt skrrt
Oh, oh, oh, your love makes me grow stronger
It keeps goin' on, oh, baby, I'm glad I found you
I just love to be around you, oh, baby
You've been so good to me, oh, baby, oh, oh, oh
You know, one time things got so bad until
I had to go to one of my friends and talk to him
And I told him, I said, ""You know
I'm having problems with the woman that I love
It seems that I call her on the phone and I, I just can't get her to answer
And then I went to her house and I saw a car parked in the driveway
I knocked on the door, but still my knocks went unanswered
And then I went home and I, I watched television until television went off
[Produced by Dave Tozer, Hit-Boy & Kanye West]
I'm so, excited
I'm home, been grindin'

When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace.
I told God I'd be back in a second,
Man It's so hard not to act reckless.
To whom much is given much is tested.
Get arrested, got some chili, get the message.
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny,
And What I do? Act more stupidly.
Bought More Jewelry, More Louis V, My momma couldn't get through to me.
The drama, people suing me,
I'm on T. V. Talking like it's just you and me.
I'm just saying how I feel man,
I ain't one of the Cosby's I ain't go to Hill, man
I guess the money should've changed him,

And yo, I'm far from a hater
Cause suckers gotta eat too -- get y'all paper
I ain't mad at cha -- I just can't deal with these fake rappers
Cause most of these niggas wear they boxers backwards
Niggas claim king but can't govern they household
Now real niggas doing time from shit they mouth told
Why dick-eating niggas always rap with a mouth full?
But you know they don't play with me
The realest nigga alive -- what can these niggas say to me? Nothing
La la la la, wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la, then you can't tell me nothing, right?

Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing
I had a dream that Jay and Dame was back together
And in that second, everything was back the same 
In reality, your boy went to Mecca, came back
And said that I would never rap again 
But I'm back and that's the way the ball bounce 
A verse is a ounce, a album's a brick -- now it's time for traffic game
Y'all lame, I am the product
Hotter than lava, they wonder how this Roc-a-fella package came 
First you take a brick of Jay, a brick of 'Ye
Couple quarters of Freeway, an ounce of Beans
Then you kill 'em with the flow 
We the realest; even Dontrelle Willis couldn't out the team 
We speak the truth and they believe us 
Tell FEMA even Hurricane Katrina couldn't out the flames 
Roc-a-fella here to stay, we airing out y'all lames 
Free At Last on the way, so clear 'em out my lane 
Yeah homie, this the theme song
First I get my money right, then I get my team on

Everything she was doin' was cool, but it ain't Ralph though
Might have gave me head in the pool, that ain't your mouth though
Might have caught you clappin' every Sunday at church
You still ratchet cause they play your favorite song and you twerk
Designer purse on your arm, 'bout the size of a duffle bag
And them brand new titties cost a couple racks
Feelin' on a girl's ass with a troubled past
Chainsmokin' every day, at least a couple packs
You know I always hit you deeper than a baritone
Bone you with my jewelry on, that's a herringbone
Hotter than Arizon', fresher than aerosol
These condom rappin' ass niggas wasn't ever raw
It's aiight, but it ain't Ralph though
And unless you're money-talkin' keep your mouth closed
We smokin' indo outdoor, in Palo Alto
If this party ain't got hoes, my intro's my outro

Pimp game is strong, raps is just harder than they ever been
You can never win
Made my way through Hollywood fashion world adores me
Music's my first love a nine to five bores me
Love me or hate me Lil Kim come through

I came back for you, the mink rockin Benz coppin keep the bottles poppin

That's the type of brother got a castle wit' the cognac river
For a moat, I'll tell you what floats my boat
Purple silk linin', in, all of my coats
What you want? You want cashmere in the winter?
Really wanna know my worth? Wanna know my splendor?
Before, I deliver, gonna warn ya, may offend ya

Finally I think it might be right to fall in love
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I think I finally found that guy
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Cupid, I think I'm ready, ready to fall in love
I've been up and down so many times in love
And through it all, still I think I've never really known true love
But this time it could very well be a possibility
Finally, hopefully, you won't let me down this time
In a black lambo, like Bruce Wayne
Swervin', drank a bottle to ease the pain
Like a lion, I can not be truly tamed
As long as there's money to gain (Yeah)
Black sports, going about 120
Chugging down from a bottle of Henny
If I crash this shit, it won't matter, I got plenty
In terms of driving drunk I am the cognoscenti
Fuckin' with instagram hoes
Doin' 8 balls of blow
6 A.M. makin' it snow
That's just shit you gotta know
We got plans on plans on plans
Killing everybody like the Ku Klux Klan
Usin' Henny to down these xans
Keep up 'til countries put up more bans
Can't tell if I'm depressed or just partying anymore
Forgetting everything that happened before
DMT got me in between two doors
Original body got me feelin' so damn sore
Jack and Label got me jaded
Everybody else got fuckin' faded
Fuck weed though, I hate it
All I need is some blow so trade it
Got that feeling back, like Bruce Wayne

Sweet like my first kiss in the back of the flick

You just assume that I be on that supermasculine *shit*
Crackin the whip just to shut you you and fasten your lip

How many of y'all don't give a fuck about what the press say? It's 2014. College Dropout came out 2004. I want y'all to know, every time I go to the studio, every time I do an interview, every time I make a motherfuckin' t-shirt, the thing I do, I give it everything I got. And when I talk that shit, it's so that you can talk that shit. If you a fan of me, you a fan of your motherfuckin' self. You can do something that'll change the world. Look at how they try to make me look. They try to make me look crazy. And the people that write that? I don't see them performing for 90,000 motherfuckers … I know you seen movies and shit. Jimi Hendrix. John Lennon. Jim Morrison. I know y'all seen movies and shit. But y'all livin' a movie right motherfucking now. Because I AM THE NUMBER ONE MOTHERFUCKING ROCK STAR ON THE PLANET.
You know, I had a meeting with Oprah Winfrey. She wanted to give me some advice. What she told me was that the corporations are scared of me. I'm like, 'Little ol' me?! Why you scared of me?! Because I tell the kids the truth?! Why y'all scared of me?!' Why they so scared of me? … Little ol' me?' Because I want peoples' minds to finally be free. What's the new cool? What's the new cool? Can you tell me what's the new cool? Because I want to hide behind that. I need some new barricade to hide behind. I need a new cool. What's the new shit out? What's the new shit out with the most commercials at the Super Bowl? Let's just stop the music and play a Bruno Mars song right now, how about that? They told me I would never play at the Super Bowl. They told me I could never play at the Super Bowl. Not until I'm super old. Not until I'm super old … They told me I would never play at the Super Bowl. They told me I would never play at the Super Bowl, at least not until I'm super old. So I think it's time—hold up, f—k that toast.

This performance features a clear example of using symbolism to enrich the message of the song
Blood on the Leaves tells the story of a relationship torn apart by materialism, unprotected sex, and drugs. West samples Nina Simone's rendition of 'Strange Fruit', a song that paints a vivid picture of racial violence in the segregated South. West samples the line: ""Black bodies swinging from the summer breeze; strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees."" The frenzied, pitched up use of this line cast the song in a racial light. The characters in 'Blood on the Leaves' become the lynched victims in 'Strange Fruit'. Instead of racial violence, these characters have fallen victim to the perils of materialism, drugs and unprotected sex, all of which are issues that disproportionately affect the black community
West performed this song,already saturated with meaning, at the VMA awards in front of a purposefully lighted and positioned backdrop of a photo by film director Steven McQueen. The photo depicts a tree in New Orleans that was the site of racially charged lynchings. It's lit and positioned in such a way that as West performs in front of it, he appears as a shadow, his erratic movements almost resembling a man hanging from the branches. The shadows of the audience's raised hands appear at the bottom of the frame, as if coming out of the ground, representing the scores of victims buried at sites like this across America

For my theme song
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
My money was number one draft pick
They still burned his jersey in Akron
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt

Y'all can't keep playing with my emotions
skrrt skrrt
So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go DOWN
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control NOW
But there's nowhere to go NOW
And there's no way to slow DOWN
Runnin' outta time - movin' fast
So just sit back and enjoy the crash
Ooh baby, the day you stepped into my world
You noticed I'm the kind of girl who loves her diamonds and white pearls
So tempt me to jet set away in London
To sip on some tea, you surprise me with gifts from Tiffany
Ooh (La la la la la la la la)
I love the way we livin' boy
But my daddy say, ""You don't need that boy""
So let's run away, let's run away (way, way)
Momma say I'm too young for love
And lovin' you is all I'm thinkin' of
My heart tells me that you're the one
It's the feeling you give, it is
Pure bliss
Like you've got the key to my heart
Simple as a touch and a kiss
Never knew a feeling like this
Pure bliss, pure bliss
Nobody can tear us apart
Baby it's as good as it gets (Kiss kiss kiss kiss)
Loving you will never be hard
This is pure bliss
[Produced by: Boi-1da & Vinylz]
Look, I feel blessed
Way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed
Straight up
I live the life I deserve, bless
Fuck a vacay I feel better at work
I mean whatever it's worth
I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gonna go to Hell and back for me
I'mma give em Heaven on Earth for a hell of a check
Yeah whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life man that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like its a reverend
I tell the truth like father forgive me these are all my confessions
Man this wasn't luck it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd, and Eddy
Who flip like confetti and then when you back they back to call you ""dog""
That shit get get petty, bitch don't give no dap to me nigga
Funny thing about talkin' behind my back
Is that it just keep comin' back to me nigga
Was all for a sec now its back to me nigga
You mad at me, this ain't what I want man this what it had to be
This is that late night workin' after three
Man this why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty
Man, the clique is the tightest, the pussy's the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just got it, thank God that we got it, blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your profit we profit, oh God
I'm here for a good time not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Look, I ain't gonna say that we back or nothin'
Cause that implies that we're back from somethin'
If we're back from somethin' its some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothin' less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammy's go
I just gave out Grammy's on my Instagram
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Feels like I'm
How could it be, little me
Had the power to be the best B, in the league
Yeah inevitably, but could it be little me
You was heckling me, now it's monotony winning regularly
I catch rec on recreation, so I exceed all your expectations
Bitches ain't got it in ‘em, I kill ‘em and then I skin ‘em
The contract was signed but I am the addendum
So wh-where my dawgs at, Randy
Ma-ma-matter fact, get off my dick bitch, Andy
Ca-ca-ca-cause everything is fine and dandy
Go against me nooooow, I dare you, Bambi
Half a million dollars just to upgrade the car show
I ain't even detonate the bombs in the arsenal
Before the storm comes the calm
Hope you can take the heat like LeBron
Ahh, ha hahahaha ha
I'm the best now, anybody with some money should invest now
Soccer moms need to organize a pep rall'
You game over bitch, Gatorade, wet towel
Mothafuckers ain't ready, they neva' been
As long as I am in the game, you'll never win
I'm on that different type of high, heroin
Put on my cape and hit the sky, heroine!
skrrt skrrt
Whose fault?
Let's play the blame game, I love you, more
skrrt skrrt
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call out names, names, for sure
I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort, and my first result
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it you know we both were wrong
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
skrrt skrrt
Let's call her names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call her names, names, for sure
On a bathroom wall I wrote
""I'd rather argue with you than be with someone else""
I took a piss and dismiss it like ""fuck it""
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fucking self
Till about two a.m. and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help...
You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up, fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
Cause I definitely be having mine
And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin' you
Lying, say I hit you, he sitting there consoling you
Running my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
One a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brother's phone like what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew, he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That ain't right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said, ""Yeezy, I ain't your right girl""
You'll probably find one of them ""I like art""-type girls
All of the lights, she-was-caught-in-the-hype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
Now who to blame, you to blame, me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Lets play the blame game
[Young Thug]
Pourin' up 'til I can't feel my anger
Serve my nigga Yeezy with a banger
I was sharin' all my thoughts with a stranger
Wrestle this bitch like Kurt no Angle
Diamonds drippin' on me like a sink
skrrt skrrt
Aw shit okay
God! God! God! God! God!
Welcome to your life
Diamond through the light
This Miami vice
It's that life (okay, okay)
Dodging bullets in the air when (okay, okay)
There's cameras everywhere and (okay, okay)
You don't know how to act right
Everybody wants to rule the world
For my theme song (black)
My leather black jeans on (black)
skrrt skrrt
Pardon, I'm gettin' my scream on
Enter the kingdom (black)
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong (skrrrrrt)
Middle America packed in (black)
Came to see me in my black skin (black)
Number one question they're askin' (straight up!)
Fuck every question you askin' (black)
If I don't get ran out by Catholics (black)

Actin' on your worst behavior
Turn your back on all your haters

For my theme song, my leather black jeans on
My by any means on, pardon I'm getting my scream on
Enter the kingdom but watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman at the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in, came to see me in my black skin
Number one question they asking, fuck every question you asking
If I don't get ran out by Catholics, here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreacting like them black kids in Chiraq bitch
Four in the morning, and I'm zonin'

Yeah birthday, it's your birthday
If I die bury me inside that Louis store
They ask me what I do and who I do it for
And how I come up with this shit up in the studio
skrrt skrrt

When I die, bury me inside the Gucci store
When I die, bury me inside the Louis store

She got a big booty so I call her Big Booty
Scrr..Scrr.. wrists moving, cooking, getting to it
I'm in the kitchen, yams everywhere
Just made a juug, I got bands everywhere
You the realest nigga breathing if I hold my breath
Referee, with the whistle, brrrrrt, hold his tech
Extendo clip, extendo roll
When your girl leave me she need a hair salon
Hair weave killer going on a trapathon
See I done had more bombs than Pakistan
Dope bomb, dro bomb, and a pill bomb
See nigga, I'm balling, you in will call
When I die, bury me inside the jewelry store
When I die, bury me inside the Truey store
True to my religion, two everything I'm too different
So when I die, bury me next to two bitches
Ah, Yeezy Yeezy how you do it huh
It's my birthday, I deserve to be greedy huh
She holding out, she ain't giving to the needy huh
Nobody ever really loved loved loved loved
Me me me me me me me me…
She say she gotta do her nails and condition her hair
Find a pair of shoes and a fittin' brasier
Slick shorty describe her description it's fair
But say no other chick in this world can compare
And no other nigga got permission to stare
I say I never listen
Never mention I care
When they gone I never miss em
Never diss em a tear
Cause other women to fill that position is there
It's the same game just a different affair
Different dame, different name, different distance from here
She say well things gon change
Now her mission is clear
Let her get off the phone and get off to homes
She knock on the door
It's business from there
Start strippin' her gear and switchin' her rear
I'm not flinchin'
Cartier on my vision impaired
And enough ice
To condition the air
Now the boy got game and the girl got hurt
The boy got brains and the girl got worth
Cause the boy got fame
Do whatever he say
Now the boy get paged like every other day

Nobody ever really loved me
It's just the birds and the bees
The her's and the he's
The his the ma'ams
The sirs and the she's
C'mon, c'mon
And u know this man
And if somebody ever loved me
She say she gotta get him dressed and hit him with rules
Feed ‘em breakfast and send ‘em to school
She say she need a rest her mind she finna lose
I tell her recline ke' and just keep cool
skrrt skrrt
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do cause the lie becomes the truth
Hey
(Yeah! Uh... Uh uh...)
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
skrrt skrrt
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
For 40 days and for 40 nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Hey big spender, hey big spender, hey big spender

I don't see no shows, I don't see no rolls
I don't see no lolos, and a low profile
As far as the wardrobe goes, all those ain't your clothes
The product placement videos with no logos
You got a chain, no glow
Got a deal, no dough
Just the same, Joe small throwbacks and corn ropes
Not a good first weeks, worry gonna blow
But there's no need to front you broke we both know
Had the hoes rolling in drows
Now you over exposed
Pointing to your account and the amounts you owe
Your record was so close not def just so so
How you label don't know you on talking no show
The only time you in the streets is just signs for promos
Yo everybody know who wrote your stole flow
You gotta pay him too, your publician's a no go
I got speddy gonzales dollars and yours is slow mo
You never seen a nigga quite like this before
He was stunting hard as hell before you even got to blow
Magazines claim he gassed like Texaco
Cause Jesus walk with him in Mexico
Back when the cars cost too much to floss
She finally made it. The stars are out tonight. Ooooh weee!
Big screen
skrrt skrrt
She wants the big screen
skrrt skrrt
She wants it

At first came the breast and then the dookie chain
Got a little hoochie game and then the Gucci came
The Ultima and then the Mustang
Lookin' in the mirror, ""Aye"" she must say
Diane Keaton
A gangster she was seekin'
With two then the three can keep a secret
Bein' exposed to the goals of a baller
So she drove a Rolls with a Prada
Put up the ?, rocked Fendi
Rarely Ed Hardy she said the shit was trendy
Married to the mob like she was Miss Wendy
She would spend the bread of men instead of spendin'
Her own, her tone was eccentric
The Gulf coast was home for this mistress
Felt pain, but shoppin' killed this
Then a little bit of Wayne lent her something for this princess

My big brother was Big's brother
skrrt skrrt
Who was hip hop brother
Who was No I.D friend
No I.D My mentor
Now let the story begin
Its the hard knock life tour
Sell out, picture us in the mall
Copin iceberg and yell out Jigga
Yea that's what we would yell out, yell out
You know the name, do gotta spell out or tell bout
J a y an Ye so shy
Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind he could change your life
With all these beats I did at least let him hear it
At least you could brag to your friends back at the gig
But he got me out my mama crib
Then he help me get my mama a crib
Big brother was Big's Brother
Used to be Dame and Big's Brother
Who was hip hop brother, who was No I.D friend
No I.D my mentor, now let the story begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands
Fresh off the plane I'm off to Baseline
Nothing handed out, I'm about to take mine
Around the same time of that Blueprint 1
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
I'd play my little song in that old back room
He would bob his head and say, damn, oh, that's you
But by The Black Album I was blacking out
Party at S.O.B's and we had packed the crowd
Big brother got his show up in Madison Square
And I'm like yea, yea we gonna be there
But not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carleen told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinking a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess ill understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm at the top and everybody on the scrotum
My big Brother was Big's brother

I guess I get mad when you get boxed in

This the way that we gon', time; we gotta move it to the future
Karma Sutra, any way that suit ya
Don't shoot ya, stop the violence and it's been stopped
We stopped the violence in the hip-hop
We stopped the hatin' and the degradation
We 'bout to build like One Nation
Got off the phone with Benjamin Carson
skrrt skrrt
Burn it down, burn Hollywood, burn like Ice Cube said
I'm the rudest, a lot of people say that
Cause they say, ""Ye, don't play that""
They be off that Grey Goose, I be off that Ye Juice
That's the way I stay loose
skrrt skrrt
My crib's spatial and my relationship is interracial
I don't know where to start, I don't know where to start
Maybe the chart, maybe the heart
Maybe the flow, maybe the gold
Where I was grown, what I grew up in
Well, you see, my mama divorced my daddy
And moved my family when I was 3
And in the cold, straight from Chicago where I go
And everybody know, from my homie Don C, I be air

My raps is better than yours
My plaques is better than yours

Bought my Mom a purse now she Louis Vuitton Mom

Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on

But oooh child you my destiny, and I know it's especially
Hard with all these girls just testing me
Uh and you gon' question me
If she even stand next to me but you should laugh
Cause you my better half (woman laughing)
And these girls just fighting over the rest of me
Right now it feels so crazy, I know she just some lady
And my outfit is just so 80's
Not to mention McLaren Mercedes
And the 26 inch rim wheels looks so good with your 6-inch heels
Fly that you be on
Gucci on, aligned by Louie Vuitton
And we high as the way we cruising on
High like I like mercury
Why do I mention the solar system?
Cause, you in my soul and system
And we gon' take her home with this one
I got something that you gon' like
You got something that I can't fight
We got something that we both gon' like
[Bridge: Ne-Yo]
And I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction, I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it
You know you got me fucked up
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna touch nobody else
Physically I'm so, so into you
Daydream about us, even when I'm by myself, yeah, yeah, yeah

But I love them feelings
You give me when I'm wrapped up in your love

skrrt skrrt
Girl you love it when I take my tongue and dive in
Oh...um..
Wha? Hehe..

5. Nas - ""Queens Get The Money"" Produced by Jay Electronica That's right! Before he signed to Jigga man, Jay Electricity was off producing for none other than Nas. This is minimalistic beat 101 - a cold Jay Electronica beat stripped bare of drums. The piano throughout the whole record is a looped sample from ""Summer 78 (Instrumental)"" by Yann Tiersen 
The track also features a lion roar in the beginning of the song. Nas uses this as a statement that he's going in on the beat and pulling no punches! – 0nelove 4. ScHoolboy Q - ""Hoover Street"" Produced by Sounwave Sounwave is an in-house producer for TDE & produced two of the best tracks from Kendrick Lamar's good kid, m.A.A.d city. The intro starts at 84BPM, switching to 79BPM when the beat changes from the first verse onwards. During the intro, Sounwave makes use of vocal layering and reverb to echo the ""How'd it feel"" section. The instrumentation varies; using drums and other percussion, synths, FX (scratches, Lex Luger one-shots) and occasional brass. Thundercat was the bass guitarist on the song! 
The track contains 2 samples both after the intro and beat changes; 
A subtle vocal sample from ""The Chamb"" by The Mohawks in the background and the drums from ""Ain't No Sunshine"" by Harlem Underground Band 
Originally this song was called ""Familia"" and in the last seconds they switched sample, the prior was done by Alchemist so he didn't get any credit. – UnBalanced 3. Capital STEEZ - ""Dead Prez"" Produced by Joey Bada$$ The instrumental is dark and jazzy. It sets the tone for Capital STEEZ's rapping with the creation of a mournful mood, which complements the melancholy lyrics on the topic of his goals in rap 
I know what it's like to feel down little girl
I hope someone lifts you up like the big guy who lifted me up
I'm talkin about the big guy right here: Cleveland Brown
Not long ago I was lower than Lohan
No plan, a lost man, raisin' my little girl in a Cadillac Brougham
My quest success, but my life was a mess
Poor Kenny West, no zest, anti-depressed
Not dressed to impress
Matter fact more stressed
Than John Mayer waiting on his AIDS test
Then I met a man who taught me how to live large
skrrt skrrt
I want to be as free as the spirits of those who left
I'm talking Malcolm, Coltrane, my man Yusef
Through death grew conception, new breath and resurrection
For moms, new steps in a direction
In the right way, told her, ""Inside is where the fight lay
And everything a nigga do may not be what he might say""
Chicago nights they, stay on the mind
But I write many lives, they, lay on these lines
Wavin' signs of the times, many say the grind's on the mind
Shorties blunted-eyed and everyone wanna rhyme
Cole world, cold blooded
Trapping niggas at my shows and them hoes love it
Backpacking niggas with the afroes love it
So don't holla at a nigga if you got no budget
Trying to get my braid up, nope not talking cornrows
Trying to get my grade up, oh, look how my score rose
Playing Jigga hits he say good, make more those
Cole got delivery bitch, you got digiornos
They fucking with me because I'm real as shit
Well if you feel this shit, here goes some realer shit
I signed a big deal and went to the dealership
Man they took one look at my credit and said forget it
Now I'm in this train with a mil to my name
Ain't shit changed because I still feel the pain
Like a gym or a rim dog, I'm built for the game
Something like a pimp because I'm still with the 'caine
Unh, a little drug dealer reference what, I can't try
These niggas out here lying, why can't I
Flashbacks where my teacher told me I can't fly
Then he looked at nigga crazy because I say why
Now look, no wings but I'm flier than the birds
Co-signer on a beamer, but it's whiter than the burbs
Yessir, What's good
Look, I feel like every great rapper has one of these man
No hooks, just bars
Let me catch my breath right quick, Let's go!
What it do, was twenty-two up in my the room
Thinkin' bout a way that I could make a move, make a boom
Debated to move to L.A. to make it in movies
But traded the pool shade and gravitated to music
Now I'm spittin' the hottest shit, it don't matter the competition
Is sadder than a bladder that be lackin a pot to piss in
It's actually kinda sicknin', the rap is beyond horrific
Admit it bruh, Waka Flocka Flame is somehow respected?
The game has gotta change, used to listen to Jay
Up on the train, now they floodin' the waves with 2 chainz
I feel like I separate with my lines like 2 lanes
It's a dark knight when the joker's better than them banes
Of the rap game, all of 'em rap lame
They claimin' all em ballin', well then all of em Sac Kings
At least they in the league tho,I can't even cop a fuckin peacoat
That's why I'm aiming outside the box, like it's a free throw
The weed smoke fuckin the air up
Got this muthafucka snackin more than Miggy Cabrera
Got this mafucka rappin some crack and yappin about it on his cell phone
Tell holmes this is the track, that I got ma swell on
And I spit that shit so fast sometimes I need to slow it down
All these bitches up in the crib, it's like ma home a pound
Tell me I ain't hold it down
Spittin ridiculous, ticklin' bitches
Up into they britches, and rip em like tickets
And fastballs, lookin' at a cutie on the dance flo'
I visualize that booty wit the pants off
Had a little dance off, and I ain't had no shot it was the ass fault
Cuz shawty body arguably hotter than august asphault
They claimin' they great, man these rappers straight lebronin'
It's what you all been waiting for ain't it? 
What people pay paper for damn it, they can't stand it 
They want something new, so let's get reacquainted 
Became the hood favorite, I can't even explain it, I surprise myself too 
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Uh-uh-hum, and here's another hit, Barry Bonds 
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt

Dude, fresh off the plane, konichiwa bitches 
Turn around another plane, my passport on pivot 
Ask for it I did it, that asshole done did it 
Talked it then he lived it, spit it then he shit it 
I don't need writers, I might bounce ideas 
But only I could come up with some shit like this 
I done played the underdog my whole career 
I've been a very good sport, haven't I, this year 
They say, ""He going crazy and we seen this before"" 
But I'm doing pretty good as far as geniuses go 
And I'm doing pretty hood in my pink polo 
Nigga please, how you gonna say I ain't no Lo-head 
'Cause my Dior got me more model head 
I'm insulted, you should go 'head 
And bow so hard until your knees hit your forehead 
And the flow just hit code red 
Top 5 MCs, you ain't gotta remind me 
Top 5 MCs, you gotta rewind me 
I'm high up on the line, you could get behind me 
But my head's so big you can't sit behind me 
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
One for the impala's
Two for the gold D's
Three for the switches
Middle finger for the police
Nigga with an attitude, I will not let it die
Four fingers up, two twisted for the west side [x2]
Yo
I used to dribble the rock down the block, in '94
Shoot the courts out
And Killer Wayne brought that Porsche out
I had the illest jump shot
So he bet all his money on me
12 years old with the hunny's on me
Patrick Ewings on
I kept fresh kicks, take a nigga out his Jordan's if the motherfuckers fit
They fit
So I'm back up the block
Fuckin' with the homies tryin' to teach them how to slap box
In front of the crack spot
Fiends fighting over crack rock
Dimes The size of golf balls, yeah them shits was that hot
He had them black Locs like MC Ren
And Debull came through in that coke white Benz
Before 106 & Park and 24 inch rims
Before these corny nigga's kept these stickers under they brims
It was a little nigga in Compton, 5'10""
He was dope as a motherfucker
I wanted to be like him
Fuck it I ain't gonna lie homie
I used to do the hammer dance
Make it worse I steel toes on and hammer pants fucked up right?
That's when my pops had the weight
He had to blow when I was blowin' in Nintendo tapes
Got my ass whooped for taken the duck hunting gun outside
In my window watching all the kids have fun outside
Ice cream truck makin noise, I want to run outside
But I'mma get my ass whooped again if I run outside
Swear I was on punishment until my tenth grade year
This new girl move on the block, light skin with wavy hair
I asked her if she want to hump me, she was like: ""I don't care""
So I took off her training bra
That's when she got scared
She wanted me to be her boyfriend
So I was like, ""Yeah""
I'm tryin' to think of LL lines in the back of my head
""When I'm alone in my room""
I can't remember what he said
But I know Uncle Luke; bitch give me some head

Play me some pimpin', mane

Let them fall in it
Let them play with all the dollars
Let them bathe in it
House so large, put a maze in it
I'm the type that take your chick out for lunch
In the middle of the White House lawn
Then switch up, start filming porn
Might tell the First Lady she can join
Do what I want when I want
Nigga you can keep them two pennies
I got a tub so big you can come and take swimmin' lessons in it
Now I'm peelin' off in a spaceship, with the ceiling
She just want to show her titties off
Carpet roll out, wanna hop off
Bout to hit the club like golf balls
Paparazzi tryna catch a nigga off guard
Nigga got me off the chain like guard dogs
Come on, dog
I'm too high, hot air balloon
All star, I'm on another planet
I just joined the fortune five hundred
Now I'm in the boardroom in pajamas

When I first took a look my mouth was wide
Look at titty's with them little, bitty shorts
You got on with the thighs hanging out the side
When you work it you gon' hurt these other bitches. (That's right)
Turning me on with the way you're strutting
Even though you only walking
It be still looking like you shouldn't do that shit in public
I can tell it now from what I see you're working with
You ain't even got to ask for the blunt
Booty so fat
Gap so nice you can see the ass from the front
You fitting to hurt me how you twerk that thing
You get me heated when you pop it, baby!
Fell in love when you came up in the club
With the whole bottle of Mo', don't pop it, baby!

Now go and put on the bikini for the Lamborghini
Now let me see you in a thong for the big Brougham
And when you shake it for the dollar, holler when you see me
Now I don't want to see no fatty full of rigor mortis
Go ahead and jiggle it for the one with money in his hands
Go and get up off the stage with your thick ass
And come over here by the table and give me a lap dance
Bend it over, come and get this dust
Got a player thinking that we fitting to cut
Gots to hit that from the back
Shorty got a little junk in the trunk
Look at how she make one butt cheek freeze
Look at how she make the other cheek move fast
Look at how she switch, make the other cheek move
Then work both sides and clap that ass
Remember them times
When you met two shorty's and you really want the cutey
Look at that shit. They took my fucking stage off of SNL. Without asking me. Now I'm bummed. That and Taylor Swift, fake ass. Now I ain't gonna do this, we breaking the motherfucking internet. I went through six years of this fucking shit. Let's get to it bro. Let's get to it bro.
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Lets take it back to basics
When shit gets worse we converse
How we need a New Balance before the lines get crossed like Asics
Just look at what we got, if we don't shoot the Reeboks
This is a beat that no flow can detox
So the respect is due like my Louie back
I don't wanna have to check you
I'm as Chi as buck-fifty's and Pelle Pelle Leathers
Some say, my beats made the Bulls play better
I say, black on black is the hate that hate made
Sara Lee with the dough I'm talkin' bout the cake maid
McDonalds with the flow, served over over a billion
You've seen the video, words over the building
Uh, I wish I could give you this feeling, I wish I could give you this feeling
And when The Workout Plan ain't work out man
It's your boy Ne-Yo, we gonna do it like this
The Roc is in the building, yeah

Yo, the monster don is in the building, we in here
Kanye West is in the building

Put Eva Mendes to sleep
Yo pardon, that bitch been on my mind all week 
But back to you, MAC gloss chick, you're way fit 
How you have everything in this world and waste it 
Prince told me it'll be ok 
I'm so sick like Ne-Yo say 
I'm laid back, like neo-soul 
I holla back at this Creole ho
She from the N.O., but she never told me ""N-O"" so 
We at the spot to chill, where the food get grilled
She ordered the Kobe beef like Shaquille O'Neal 
Second I walked in, the whole room got still
I don't know how to put this, but I'm kind of a big deal 
Damn, damn, ma, we ain't even have to go through it like that
It wasn't even, even that big, man
You know, nah, it's ight though
But anyway, yo, let me get that coat
Let me get those jeans, and let me get that rock on your finger

Aiyo, I should just bark on you, burn your car on you
Cuz I'm too much man, to leave a mark on you
You'se a bird, you know that, giving that man
Ten points, like he about to blow that
He probably did, you swallow his kids?
In and out of jail, he a snail, he wasn't wilding on bids
In the summertime, I broke his jaw, had to do it to him
Quick, old fashion, in the back of the mall
Me and him had 'mos forever, like I'm supposed to put him on
When he came home and told on Trevor
Had to bang on homey, ear blocks, out in spots
Throwing them shots, like 'nigga, you know me'
Stop fronting for them people outside like you really ride
And you a silly chick, thought you was really live
But I guess I was wrong, I'mma holla at dog
And rip his head off, words of a song
skrrt skrrt
Aiyo, I thought we was iller than that, all them kisses
And love yous, when jake came, you hid my packs
It was time a brother went to war, vests banged up
Staining in the kitchen, yo, holding a four

Say Ludacris 6 million sold
In your high honour
All over my skin thats art splattered
And everything happened this part mattered
I tattoed your name on my tongue
Then my heart shattered
But for effort I get an A, girl
So tonight be the VIP guests of JYJ Malik Yusef and Kanye West
Living life like there's no damn rules
Tonight I'm finna hop up in that hotel pool
Grab your hand, white dress, you gon' hop in too
Get everything that bein' at the top includes
What's your friend's attitude, why she so damn rude? huh?
Tell her smile for a change
If a baller come around, she gone smile for the change
I know they type, I know the life
I know you're living your life for the night, another night
Ask the city what they got for us

Yo, uh, yo
Ay ay ay, leaving niggas with nothing to say-ay-ay
Go on fay-ay-ay, partners and compadre-ay-ays
Menu for today-ay-ay happens to be the emcee-ay-ay
With a slice of ham and a sunny side ay-ay-egg
I choose a new style to play-ay-ay
Me and James Ingram found more than a hundred way-ay-ays
Say say say what? Me and my niggas came to parlay-ay-ay
You couldn't fuck with us tomorrow or today-ay-ay
Lay back, keep it smooth Marvin Gaye-ay-way
Shit bangin harder than my ay-ay-A-K spray-ay-ay
Never cuse those who player hay-ay-ate
Eventually y'all will come around my way-ay-ay
Like I said nothing to say-ay-ay
You fake niggas stray way like the mind of a child born into K-K-K
Ain't a dollar sign out there to match my resume-ay-ay
But if you insist, I'll take a mill-ion today-ay-ay-ay-ay
Save the other ten for me-ay-ay
Stutter stutter rap, bringing it back to slay-ay-ay
You niggas who lack orginalitay-ay-ay
I'm bringing it back for y'all niggas who lack originalitay-ay-ay
Every copy you'll skip I'll sell from here to Pompei-ay-ay
My shit remains the bomb diggy-ay-ay
Remain ill to the saukratizzy way
You don't need me to ever write
I read your last message at least 1000 times
At least 1000, at least 1000 times

skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Yeah, I'd rather do nothing with you
skrrt skrrt
I told you I don't want you all the time
Cause you're not mine
I'm not in love, but I'm in like
So far it's working fine
But when I need you then I'm desperate
I'm a little child
Just like an animal, down on my knees and beggin'
Yeah, all wrapped up, I wanna be your little baby now
Put my head on your shoulder
You can rock me, rock me now
In the middle of the night you can hear me crying loud
Put my head on your shoulder and rock me
[Post-Chorus]
Open the door, unlock me
We've got tonight, so rock me now
I'm in my bed, and I'm obsessed
I'm lying wide awake
I need someone like you to come
And put me in my place
Cause in the day, I can't be tamed
Boy, you don't wanna know
But in the night, my hands are tied
You tell me where to go
I don’t know why niggas tripping on a nigga
For clippers, I hate you niggas too
But I’m black and Mexican, we gon’ change that, haha
I hate you niggas too!
If you ain’t had good pussy, nigga, try some
Your girl ain’t got no ass, she need to buy one
Out west, Southwest, where you fly from
New Jersey, Teterboro where I fly from
You ain’t got no Ghost, you need to drive one
That bitch is so broke, try to find some
And she ain’t got no money, tryna find some
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
You still owe me money, nigga, yeah, yeah
Got a bad bitch at build-a-body
Get a bad bitch and build a body
When your pop, the slim nigga shady
When your pop was Slim, I was Baby
I came for them chips like I’m K.D
Came for them bricks like I’m Maisie
We hit up the trap which is booming
Hustle, French John Newman
Fuck making the move, we the movie
Fuck the whole group, I’m a groupie
All that money rolling through the lobby
VVS is dripping off my body
You can do what you want when you got it
Go get a bitch and then build her body
They wanted Versace Milan
We do what we want and then copy
Smack a Roley on my arm
Skrrr, middle fingers to the feds
Put a hundred dollars on your head
Price of life hit you
And all my dawgs gotta eat
And all the money get divided
Snipe game be the wildest
Get a bad bitch, build her body
Get a bad bitch, build her body, haan

The game's on, Hot Karl dominates y'all ears
I'm making suckas disappear like Amil's career
I'm just joking but you having trouble coping
Cause you beating me is like Def Leppard's drummer jump-roping (not happening)
Cause me and Kanye made this real picante
And grande, while you suckas act Armand Assante
Suburban strangler, angled to rip a stranger
With lyrics so hard I even make Mystikal say ""danger""
And right here's an MC that you should fear
Underground like snuff films, throwing 'bows like Laimbeer
Crushing the rest 'til there ain't nobody left
And if I don't go double platinum then I'm blaming Wyclef
So rhyme for rhyme, line for line let's get it done
None other will do when my crew's out there having fun
Punchlines like landmines, Bensonhurst to Anaheim
I'm dropping dimes while y'all suckas silent like pantomimes
What
Don't let me
Run off at the mouth
I'm always into something, got everybody running
It's my year, dawg, warn Tyrese that I'm coming (I'm coming!)
Fucking up the scene, take away the self-esteem
The Jewish Jay-Z, call me William Hollastein (Hova!)
I keep attacking and send your crew packing
Nobody's feeling you, like Kobe Bryant rapping (ouch)
So keep on yapping, it's obvious you hate me
Real racy, expose myself like I was K-Ci
Now I'm bringing new views to the table
Able to bring in more kids than Jermaine Dupri's label (so def)
Take you out and watch you blow come to an end
Able to go three the hard way without Puffy's friends (let's did it)
Martin Lawrence(speaks while choruses are sang):""look here, lemme tell you something, ya know. I'm tired a arguin im tryna share this wit chu,ok? I'm tryna giv this to yooou, ya know what im sayin? To Yooou, you know? This..if you don't, y-you can't get wit the indoor pool, the outdoor pool, or lil music studio thing, the little bowlin thang, ya know what im sayin? Hm, this is yours. But chu don't like that, then fiiine man. You can leave. You can allllways leave. I'm not holdin you here""

1st Verse:
I gotta girl at home
But she don't cook
I have my condoms in the store cause she won't look
And she neva-eva go to the grocery sto
So I figure it's safe to pull a grocery-ho
She was buyin Alize out the liquor aisle
She said, 'i hope its not too ghetto'
Rock-Dawg, Gold Force, Baggy style
I kept her number on file
For my girl be actin wyld
Like last week, I told her take me to the mall
skrrt skrrt
My otha girl picked me up at 3:05
She got a brand new car, sixteen
Now the car only 1 yrs old, oh
Man, but the body look grown, ""whooa!""
Before I catch a case I betta take my ass home
Where the problems is
Arguments be daily like
Carson is
Martin again:
Fuck you. Fuck yooou. I on't give a fuck whatchu have. This little indoor-indoor, outdoor pool, little bowlin alley. Material buuullshit. It don't mean shit. It don't make what's in the muthafuckin heart""

2nd Verse:
Hol' up, wait a second man
That's that thrift sto info
That's sauce again
Why don't chu talk to the mouth a the horses
Bout my porshes?
Condo's in front a the golf courses
Instead you stay up
Count every second like a fake rolley
There must be more good women than men percentage wise 
So her chance of having a husband just minimize 
That's why a lot of girls claim they ain't into guys 
And mess with other girls part time to improvise 
I knew she wouldn't vibrate 
No I seen her inner eyes 
But I'm like any other guy trying to get in her thighs 
She telling me about how black people should enterprise 
And I'm like, if you don't get your ass in this ride from enterprise 
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by 5 
With the gas fully filled up like I didn't drive 
Told her I had a girl, nah I didn't lie 
Told her this rap game is alright. I'm just getting by 
She had a lil weed and we get a lil high 
And I'm looking in her eyes and I'm loving her vibrate 
Told me back in 95' she fell in love with the tribe 
Boo back in 92' I was just like you 
Please don't be confused by the ice and jewels 
I'm like any other guy buy ice to stay cool 
Like any other kid that claim they hate school 
And think yeah Free's banging but she's no Rachel. 
We ball 'til we fall 
Hit the mall 
After we 
Hit don't call 
We fill your lives 
With nothing but lies 
And I would like to 
Apologize. 
But you can't stand right here 
And tell me everything is going to be alright 
'Cause until the day a real man stands up 
skrrt skrrt
Don't be so paranoid, don't be so
Baby, don't worry about it
Hey there, don't even think about it
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Tell me right now, you really wanna spend your whole life alone
A little time out might do ya good, might do us good
Before you're done for good because I could make it good
I could make it hood, I could make you come
I could make you go, I could make you hot
I could make you fly, make you touch the sky
Hey, maybe so
All of the time he be up in my
Checking through my cell phone, baby no
You wanna kill the vibe on another night, here's another fight
Oh, here we go
(Oh, here we go)
Baby don't worry 'bout it
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
(They don't know)
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
All of the time, you wanna complain about the nights alone
So now you here with me, social gratitude
Leave the attitude way back at home
skrrt skrrt
I mean wow. You know? Man
Lookin' out my loft windows man my dreams became true
Lookin' at the mirror, wondering if it's the same dude
Lookin' at my closet wondering if it's all about clothes
Look right next to me, wondering if it's all about
Hop in the car and asked the OnStar where this life goes
And I drive so fast I blur the light post
They say Drive Slow, I say ""I know""
Then errrr, away I go
And the way I flew
In this year or two
I know this is what God put me here to do
But in this excitement
You just might miss
A shorty with a demo like ""Hey, you might like this""
And see
He
Remind me of me
Just a year ago
Now he
Tellin' me
I'm his her-ro-oh
I took his CD and asked him what he's lookin' for
He said, ""Man, I don't know. Maybe a miracle""

He's gonna take what you can't take back
Then he's gone out the door on a whim

Thanks for having me Tony, you know
She got money from her last two exes
No kids, new Jag, new Lexus
And cook a bad ass breakfast
Just incredible, how the sex is
So I leave her but then I come right back
She be catchin' attitude and I don't like that
Wanna talk that shit, I'mma strike back
Only for the makeup sex and the night cap
They got a bed on the beach and
My thing got beef with your coochie
Got money, still sneak in the movie
Love the adventure and when you do me
I heard last man, soft ass friend like macho man
Lil' tight ass shirt on, let's just call him not your man
skrrt skrrt
F.G., all these, freak bitches wanna sex me
But due to the fact I'm a mac with a mothafuckin' sack
Man a bitch can't stress me
I'm with Alicia, Lauren, and Leslie
Miami rooftop Cabana
Heard they fucked my crew from Atlanta
Now I'm tryna hit it so pardon my manners
I was born with it so pardon this pimpin'
Can't learn nothin' talkin', bitch listen
Need a thick rare thing up in my bed frame
You look like you fit that description
Get up in the GT and get missin'
Push button start, the keyless ignition
Whole damn thing, it cost me 240
'Fore I left the lot I slapped it on Forgi's, uh
And it don't really matter what you do
Cause I don't know another chick like you
From the back to the front to the side
Ain't another nigga doin' it like I do

Off, and I took a recess
When I get back you gon' take that...
Off, in the mirror like hey me, stay me
I make money, money don't make me
Hey honey, what do you take me...
For, don't look at me like I'm crazy
Don't ever think that'd phase me
You ain't finna do nothing, you ain't crazy
You ain't built like, that
Hey baby what it feel like, ahhh
Just forget I said it, screw it
It don't really matter what you do when you do it
Tony Williams in this bitch, who you is
You can go, you can come
You can walk, you can run
Do whatever you want: just have fun
Dictatorship's not for human people
What good is love if we can't be equal
[Snoop Dogg]
A pool party at the church
G'd up and others barbequeing
Ain't no telling what your daddy and your momma doing
Chewing on these baby-backs popping bottles with these macks
Everybody swimming, backyard full of women
I'm entertaining folks
Gave the lil' homie twenty dollars just to shine my hundred spokes
Coke with the Hennesey tends to be the remedy
Family and friends to me
Everyone pretends to be kin to me
I can't wait until the Fourth of July
To pop some fireworks with my kids
And fly some kites high in the sky
See, it's the family reunion
And down at the church house, they giving up the annual communion
It seems we made it to another summer
Yeah we came and come up
213 is more than friends
Yeah, we like blood brothers
Riding this 'til the wheels fall off
Can you dig that?
We got this summertime anthem for y'all
We did that
We made it through winter
We made it through fall
We made it through the spring time
Tough times and all
It's good to see
skrrt skrrt
I'm riding with the top down
Let the wind blow
Chillin' with my love
Partying fo' sho'
It feels good to see

Everybody if you with me sing
[Nate Dogg]
We got the game on lock
On the paper chase, can't stop
On a roll, still hot
Gotta be top notch
I like the girls 'cuz they hot
Angels, na, na, na, na
I got my city doing front flips
When every father, mayor, rapper jump ship
I guess that's why they call it where I stay
Clean up the streets, so my daughter can have somewhere to play
I'm the blueprint to a real man
Some of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal man
I ain't goin' to hell or to Hillman
Igh, Igh, Igh, Igh, for my real fans (You know what this is!)
I got caught up with a little Xan
Can't stop me but it slow me though
Yeah nigga famous, you don't know me though
But every DJ still play me though
Damn man, I don't even need a radio
And my new shit sound like a rodeo
Got the old folks dancing the Do-si-do
'Til they fuck around and sign me to OVO
Oooh, I just might share my next one with Keef
Got the industry in disbelief, they be asking for beef
This what it sound like when God split an atom with me
I even had Steve giving out apples for free
They was talking ""woo woo this woo wap da bam""
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me they keep me surrounded
[Post-Hook: Chance The Rapper]
Who is you? And who the fuck is you? And who is him?
All of the sudden woo wap da bam you can't touch me
Na, na, na, na I got angels
I got angels
[Produced by Darhyl Camper & Kanye West]
skrrt skrrt
If I could, I'd give you the world
Wrap it all around you
Won't be satisfied with just a piece of this heart
My angel, oh angel
You're my angel, oh angel
I spent my day so, first I pray yo
Then I lay low, looking for the halo
Or more yayo, my little angel
Reminded me to stay playful
Faithful walks I take in the woods
Thinking whats good, things that I can change I should
Things I can't, need to be understood
Th-this is the bliss, I used to drift from the hood
For a second at least, I'm resurrecting the peace
Pipes that Indians used to light, we called it Chief, right?
Stepping on the leafs right, to reach heights
Th-th-th-that I never seen, it's so so evergreen
Some use it for medicine, or to write better things
I was in Amsterdam man, bike pedalling
To the nature spot to taste the flavours they got
My eyes drop, I like it a lot
Yeah, my angel
I wanna turn up the sound and spread my wings because I'm riding with my (Angel)
Going through the city of the Chi make me feel like I'm in the city of (Angels)
Oooh I wanna fly, fly away with my (Angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (Angel)
Th-th-the way that I rhyme, blow nigga's mind
Like the first time you heard Mary J and you were standing in line
To purchase tickets to see her blow like Chicago wind
And I'm ridin with Common looking for Chicago Zen
And like Chicago winds, I was once a Street Disciple
Rockin every Jordan shoe, Nike put out by Michael
That made me feel like I could fly, sometimes I wanted to die
Prolly cause the angel dust was fuckin with my third eye
So I start hip-hop and I understand why Common used to love her
Disick: Hey, do you like Kanye West?
Cheban: Yeah, he's okay, I guess
D: Well, the early work was a little too hip-hop for me in my taste, but when Dark Twisted Fantasy came out in 2010, I think he really came into his own, both musically and lyrically
D: Kanye's been compared to Jesus, Hitler, Walt Disney, and even Steve Jobs
C: Hey Disick

In the midst of negativity
A positive sight can be blurred
And the visions that we thought were good
Seems to let evil occur
While still possessing our human form
We live life searching for greatness since the day we was born
And as we bow our heads at night, rich, wealthy
Or poor with dislike, we pray, asking for
Forgiveness for our sinful ways
With mind, body, spirit and faith, we pray
skrrt skrrt
[Interlude: Young Jeezy]
Yeah (amen) you like that right? (amen)
I wrote it myself by the way (amen)
Yo Young, Jeezy, Jizzle, Snowman (amen, amen)
We gotta give the streets what they want, man (amen)
Fuck the goddamn shit (amen)
You gotta get it in, bruh, let's get it (amen)
You like that don't you? I wrote it myself by the way
And I don't mean to be selfish
But I picture myself getting paid
And you might catch pneumonia
Cause I'm colder than a elf on a sleigh
Me and Pusha back on it
Now everybody help us pray
Lord forgive my sins and all my friends
Dollars make sense, I'm trying to get paid
Trying to get saved (too late!) time to get paid
Got a gun and a stocking mask
Niggas thought I was trying to get waves
I'mma let all ya'll niggas pray for it
My young niggas knocking off a K for it
Sold my soul on the back-end
Only fucking way I'mma pay for it
Front that shit, you put a flame on
My niggas locked in a cage for
They keep telling me to go hard
#1 spot you was made for
Yuugh! I made more
Front of the grill, got a racehorse
California Crayola red
""Glow In The Dark"" like a Ye tour
Fuck niggas stepping in my lane for
Not knowing that it's a land mine
Soon as a nigga feels a cool breeze
Throw the top up like a gang sign
Red or blue, Crip or Blood
Solitaires, diamond studs
Like chandeliers I'mma flood
Black Jesus piece like it's dipped in mud

It feels like you're on trial sometimes 
And in a relationship, you can also be on trial 
And be convicted with no jury 
And this song was sort of like that moment where someone tells you ain't, you ain't - you gotta say I am - an emancipation, if you will 
Cause you can't take that from me 
My self-esteem 
So whether it something in your own home, or a situation like mine 
Where you're under the microscope of the media

Do you have all-wheel drive

These niggas want me to go, don't they know that I'm gone
They know I'm space shuttle level, they need oxyg-g-g-gen
Don't they know that they boring? Don't they know that I yawn?
Only time they exciting is when they mentioning Shawn
Seen Single White Female when she dyed her hair blonde?
Sometimes I look at these rappers, the movie remind me of them
Somebody turn these boys off, don't they know that I'm on
Can't they see that it's foolish to try and kill me with songs
What the fuck are they Lauryn, they killing me softly
You talk me to death, only thing you can do to him
I open the door for them, what else can I do
These niggas want me to walk for them
Somebody talk to them before I go off on them
I taught 'em 'bout fish scale, they want me to fish for them
They want me to catch clean then cook up a dish for them

Alors on, throw your hands in the sky right now

Its way too much to handle in one night
Live this life like there's no tomorrow
Wake up in Paris with a Russian model
Throw your hands in the sky
If anybody got five dollars in your pocket right now
I call this club Titanic
Why, cause it's going down
Yea, you know we good

Ain't no love and it's sure nuff a pity
skrrt skrrt
When you were mine
Oh, I was feeling good
Cause you lovlied up
This whole nieghborhood
But now that you're gone
You know the sun don't shine
From the city hall to the county line
That's why I said
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
Ain't no love and it sure is a pity
skrrt skrrt
Every place that I go
Oh, it seems so strange
Without you there
Things have changed
The nights are cold
There's a blanket of gloom
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
What's your addiction? Is it money? Is it girls? Is it weed?
I've been afflicted by not one, not two, but all three
She's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us
She's coming over, so I guess, that means, I'm on drugs
Just let me peek now, I mean damn, I'm so curious
She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush
Time's of the essence, I need, you to be, spontaneous
Roll up the doge, and he ain't see you-cut the quarter, then I'm co coming over
Cause its never over
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
skrrt skrrt
I see the emotion in your eyes, that you, try not to show
We get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blow
So I pour the potion, so we could both get high, as we could go
Then I'll get the lotion, and do something to me, when your thighs is exposed
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose
Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed
Roll up the doge, and he ain't see you-cut the quarter, and I keep co coming over
'Cause its ne-never over
skrrt skrrt
And could I be a star?
Does fame in this game have to change who you are?
Or could I be the same one who came from a far away life
Just to make it in this broadway lights
Now I'm shinin in the broad, day-light - go figure
A slow transition from a lil' broke nigga from the 'Ville
Got a deal, a real life saver
Dreams of being behind the wheel like, Jada
I chill now, cop a lil' ice later
Cole, you got a glow like a lil' Lightsaber
So, clap for him, then applaud Hov
He gave 'em the platform
Flow so sick thought he wrote the rap for him - no sir
The flow cold as a shoulder of a gold diggin hoes
When a broke nigga 'proaches
Told ya I'm focused man, I'll let you muh'fuckers soak it in
Clap for him

I seen Mase do it, I seen Ye do it
X came through, caught lighter fluid
Still I came through it; clap for him!
But I'm the blueprint, I'm like the map for 'em
I dropped another classic, made Puff pass it
Nobody could touch Puff back when Puff had it
Wayne scorchin', I'll applaud him
If he keep going, pass the torch to him
50 came through like hurricanes do
I thought I'd finish his ass at Summer Jam too
I had the Illmatic on bootleg
The shit was so ahead, thought we was all dead
Wayne did ""A Milli"", 50 did a milli
Ye too, but what Em did was silly
The white boy blossomed after Dre endorsed him
His flow on ""Renegade"", fucking awesome; applaud him!

Snoop dogged it, Nelly came down
The Face Mob kept it ghetto for the H-town
Luda moved digits after he moved bitches
Drake's up next, see what he do with it
Rule had a run, couple movie parts
T.I. literally wanted to shoot up the charts
What up, Jeezy? What it do?
Y'all remind me of us in early '92
Outkast landed, 3 thou was ill
Like a male version of Lauryn Hill
Mobb Deep shook it, but Prodigy took it
A lil' too far, can't fuck with Brooklyn
Wu-Tang gang-banged it, Meth ate
Rae took on the date with the Purple Tape
Passed on to Ason and then Ghostface
They had a hell of a run, standing ovate, ayyy

How are they for real, is them niggas really paid? 
Rappers I met, or, dealt with direct 
Is it true he won't send a beat tape until he get a check? 
What's the position you hold? 
Could you really match the Neptunes, check 
By check if ""H to the Izzo"" is the only single that went gold? 
If Roc-a-fella shit fold
And you move back to the 'Go
Is it back to ghost producer for D. Dot on the low? 
For the millionth time askin' me

Can I get a minute you wack bitch?
I ain't gotta jack shit 
You heard ""Takeover"", who running this rap shit? 
skrrt skrrt
Fake tits 
Shut up and make hits 
Can't we all just get along, spread love like Take 6 
What, you doin' beats in LA for Eminem and Dr. Dre? 
Them niggas sold ten mill I'm trying to get paid 
We do this shit for entertainment 
Bring guns to the arraignment

OKAY, I RELOADED! (The League Crew!)

What, you doing beats in LA for Eminem and Dr Dre?
Them niggas sold ten mil, I'm trying to get paid
Gimme that '94 Puff shit, Ali
I'm so appalled, Louis Vuitton draws
The shit, a booth for me is a bathroom stall
If you're not fond of me, you're comedy, Little Duval
I have a lot of flaws, I'm human before all
I wake up in the morning smell some coffee, then tell your bitch to get off me
Mos Def, word to every autopsy
Man that boy bad, man that boy spaz
'Til he crash like Sandra Bullock and Luda on the ave
He changed his name, he a conscious rapper
Naw mutha'fucka I'm just Compton's rapper
I might spit some intricate shit for retards not to get
But really I'm just as rude as Marshall Mathers
Is that a contradiction? He contradicting himself again?
Of course that's a contradiction, the fuck you think life is?
We not like like Christ is
We all want ices and devices to make the bitches say I like this
People don't understand why I went southpaw
I looked in the mirror and said I can't be like y'all
I can't be like Game, I can't be like Eazy
To get in this rap game, I know it won't be easy
Cause my shit different
skrrt skrrt
He from Compton, where he from, have he killed before?
Truth is, I ain't the most ruthless, but I'm not cupid
Before she had two kids my momma worked two gigs
To get out Chicago
To move right back to another ghetto, on Sante Fe playing the lotto
I used to want a champagne two door Tahoe
Until I seen that same truck shot by five-o
Dead with his eyes closed, y'all should've seen him
Off a gallon of cough syrup, but rifles had leaned him
That's why these tough rappers man I don't believe 'em
Y'all wanna be 'em, I wanna grab bats and beat 'em
So they can feel the pain of the blocks I'm from
Where my heart turned numb
A chair is still a chair
Even when there's no one sittin' there
But a chair is not a house
skrrt skrrt
When there's no one there to hold you tight
And no one there you can kiss goodnight
Woah girl
A room is a still a room
Even when there's nothin' there but gloom
But a room is not a house
skrrt skrrt
When the two of us are far apart
And one of us has a broken heart
skrrt skrrt
Now and then I call your name
And suddenly your face appears
But it's just a crazy game
When it ends, it ends in tears
Pretty little darling, have a heart
Don't let one mistake keep us apart
I'm not meant to live alone
Turn this house into a home
When I climb the stairs and turn the key
It was all a dream
[Refrain: Faith Evans]
Last night I had a dream
Thoughts was racin through my head, it was all a dream
Felt so real to me
This is what was said
Had a dream I said
Bout who he said
Bout B.I.G. I said
That's big he said
Dig what he said, proceed he said
Indeed I said, so
Breathe I did
Don't repeat what I say I said, he said nothing
He agreed with his head
He just nodded like this
What I believe to be a yes I repeated what was said
It came to me like a whisper last evening I said
What's the deal playboy, was the greeting he said
First thing I wanted to know, what's the reason he was dead?
More money, more problems, better believe it he said
Careful what you wish for you might receive it he said
""I see"" I said, ""jealousy"" I said
Got the whole industry mad at me I said
Then B.I. said, Hov remind yourself
Nobody built like you, you designed yourself
I agree I said, my one of a kind self
Getting stoned every day like Jesus did
What he said, I said, has been said before
Just keep doin your thing he said, say no more
skrrt skrrt
[Faith Evans]
[Mike Myers]: With the breach of three levees protecting New Orleans, the landscape of the city has changed dramatically, tragically, and perhaps irreversibly. There is now over twenty-five feet of water where there was once city streets and thriving neighbourhoods.
[Kanye West]: I hate the way they portray us in the media. If you see a black family, it says “they're looting.” If you see a white family, it says “they're looking for food.” And you know, it's been five days because most of the people are black and even for me to complain about I would be a hypocrite because I've tried to turn away from the TV because it's too hard to watch. I've even been shopping before even giving a donation. So now I'm calling my business manager right now to see what's… what is the biggest amount I can give and… and just to imagine if I was… if I was down there and those are… those are my people down there. So anybody out there that wants to do anything that we can help. With… with the setup, the way America is set up to help the…uh the uh, the poor, the… the black people, the uh… the less well-off as slow as possible. I mean, this is, Red Cross is doing everything they can. We… we already realize a lot of the people that could help are at war, right now, fighting another way, and they've… they've given them permission to go down and shoot us.
skrrt skrrt
I like that because I thought you're on the way to doing things differently, all the promotion around your album. It was really like just awesome to me, because it wasn't the traditional roll out that they do to radio where they send the single and then they're doing is they're doing that and, you know, you're doing an appearance on, you know, whatever TV show. But it was really cool. It was like when you showed in over 60 cities. You showed the-- you know, I wouldn't even call them videos. It was more of like a-- just an art exhibition that you did in these different cities. It is kind of, ""What's spurred that, to do it that way?""
skrrt skrrt
I mean, we have dreams. We wake up, and we make them happen. I appreciate that my label allowed me to go unorthodox with that. And there's people at the label who appreciate it and there's people who don't appreciate that. It's like non-traditional in that way. But I have to push. And really, it's all practice to me. Being a musician is practice. Life is practice. You know, so it's not like a in go-- so I'm fine to make a mistake. I'm fine to, like, put out an auto tune album that no one understands. I'm fine to put out a complete punk new wave album that no one understands. I'm not trying to maintain, you know, some spot in the hip-hop charts on radio or something like that. I'm trying to open up people's minds. I want people to think more. I want people to feel like it's okay to create. I want people to feel like it's okay to make mistakes in front of people and follow what their dreams are and not feel boxed in. I want people to feel like, you know, awesome is possible. I want them to, you know, feel like, you know-- it's not a matter of just even what I'm doing at DONDA. It's the amount of people that are hearing me and now they're going to fight to get the best ideas out. Because the world will only be saved through good intention and design, It's not going to be saved is politics. The irony is, what holds things back? Politics! So how could that push things forward?
skrrt skrrt
I heard you say that you were trying to work out a deal with the Gap and politics held you back from doing that with your merchandise for the tour, and it may be just wonder what, sort of-- elaborate on that. What are you talking about when you say ""politics?""
skrrt skrrt
I mean it, like, what would happen if I was able to design a collection and was like backed by the Gap? It would be awesome, right?
skrrt skrrt
It would totally be awesome, but then my question for you is, but you have-- you're not hurting. You're doing well, so couldn't you just do that yourself? You don't need the Gap.
skrrt skrrt
No, you can't. You need the infrastructure. It's not a matter of just having money.
skrrt skrrt
But you have a great staff set up in everything, I feel like...
skrrt skrrt
No, I don't have a great staff at all. That is a skill set that takes years and years of anything. If I wanted to get into the coal business and I had-- and also, ""well-off"" is that, that is-- what's the word I'm looking for? I'm trying to use the simplest word sometimes. Yeah, it's all relative. Because I'm not, because, okay-- I could make an amount that seems, like, really crazy to people, like 10 million a year, right? To open up a new fashion company might costs 15 million. So if I went and took all the money I had and I invested it into trying to do it like that, it could leave me 5 million in debt.
skrrt skrrt
That's fair enough, I get that.
skrrt skrrt
And then you're not well-off.

Y'all might as well get the music ready because this finna' take a while
Umm, When I had my accident I found out at that moment nothing in life is promised except death,
If you had the opportunity to play this game of life
you need to arpeeeciate every moment
a lot of people don't appreciate their moment until it's passed
[Crowd applauds]

I am Kanye West, and that feels really great, especially to say this year. I came here to present my new video, but before that, I'ma talk. Now... Later tonight, ""Famous"" might lose to Beyoncé, but I can't be mad—I'm always wishing for Beyoncé to win, so, you know! But for people to understand just how blessed we are. It was an expression of our now. Our fame right now. Us on the inside of the TV. You know, just to put... the audacity to put Anna Wintour right next to Donald Trump... I mean, like, I put Ray J in there, bruh! This is fame, bro! Like... I see you, Amber! My wife is a G, not a lot of people's wives would let 'em say that! We came over in the same boat, now we all in the same bed. Well... maybe different boats but you know. If you think about it, last week, it was 22 people murdered in Chicago. You know like, people come to me like, ""Man, that's right! Tell Taylor to.."". Bro, like I love all y'all! That's why I called her! So I was speaking at the Art Institute last year and one kid came up to me and said, ""Three of my friends died and I don't know if I'm gonna be the next."" And it has to... you know, you have to think like, you know when you're a senior and it's like the last month and you just don't feel like doing anymore work? If you feel like you're seeing people dying right next to you, you might feel like what's the point? You know like, life could be like, start to feel worthless in a way. I know times for me, I sit down and talk to older, rich people, you know (AKA WHITE!) and uh... they tell me, ""Don't compare yourself to Steve Jobs, don't compare yourself to Walt Disney."" And my friend Sekaya told me, ""Ayy bruh bruh...""
They tell me don't compare yourself to these people right? My friend Sekaya told me it's three keys to keeping people impoverished; taking away their esteem, taking away their resources, and taking away their role models. My role models are Artists Merchants. It's less than 10 I can name in history. Truman, Ford, Hughes, Disney, Jobs, West
Zane Lowe: Nice to see you again man. Thanks for stopping by the BBC for a chat
Kanye West: Good to see you too sir. Thank you
Zane Lowe: So, I was thinking today like where do we begin? Because you've been having some remarkable conversations lately, some really in depth, really interesting conversations addressing recent things that have gone on, you know, successes, things that have kind of made people think, talk amongst themselves and it got me thinking like, where were we last time. We were 18 months ago, not far from here and so much has changed in the last 18 months. The first question I wanted to ask you, cause I've always wondered how you felt at that time 
Kanye West: I had so many interviews where I'm trying to express that I can create, that I can create outside of just the music box and I'm giving examples of work that I did that was really successful and I'm getting just completely shut down. But not just by the company we talked about last time but every single company, every single company you could imagine is just like “no, you are celebrity. You are not allowed to create, you're not allowed to think, you're not allowed to have an opinion. You're just here to wear a red leather jacket and shut up.” And it's true that as a celebrity you can help to promote something quickly but no one wanted to allow me to think or be involved in the product and you know, as I told you last time I said I'm a product guy 
Zane Lowe: Yea, and it was an electrifying conservation, and I mean, it felt like you were taking names that day, it felt like you were also trying to reach people that day and what's occurred since you know is you have made serious moves into that world. You know, what's happened recently with Yeezy supply, you know your deal with Adidas, how has that experience been overall for you now with product out and with peoples opinion about the shoes and about what they've seen -- how has that experience been for you? How can you put that into context for us? 
Kanye West: I mean, every day when you go to the gym or you go to work it's a challenge. You gotta work hard and you have to completely, tirelessly, countlessly remind people of your vision no matter what. So that's the way I'mma word it. You know what I'm saying, so we made it to a point where something extremely close, something almost to the level, something past the level of the vision finally hit the globe and Adidas was a company that was flexible enough and had been used to dealing with creatives enough to allow me to create something that was very close to my heart. You know, they original hip hop 
Zane Lowe: Of course, Run DMC man I mean they were right there at the very beginning it was kind of a perfect partnership when it was announced, you know, not long after and I wondered when did the conversation actually begin with Adidias after you starting talking about your aspirations and what you wanted to achieve in that industry? 
Kanye West: That conversation had already started before then. There was a few conversations with a few companies with a few sportswear companies and um, I remember calling Jon Wexler you know, it was a certain point where I just felt like I couldn't breathe anymore like I had all these ideas and I felt like I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone's creative, you know like we have this idea of a mass market looking at a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something. And anyone that's creative understands that there's no amount of money that can be given to them to make them not want to or have to create. There's no check out and there's no cheque to stop you from creative. No pun intended when I'm saying no check 
Zane Lowe: Was a good one though 
Kanye West: Just even thinking about it takes the breath out of me because I mean, as soon as we got the opportunity to actually start making things, there were so many ideas. I mean I look at over 500 images a day on my laptop. And I remember I went into the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know I said “people be dissing me on Hypebeast” and it's like wait a second, dude, like I been fighting this battle for a long time, since like Universe City. Like no one has any idea what the meeting were like. I'mma throw this one out here. I remember this one guy that worked for Francois Pinault the head of Kering Group came up in my apartment in Paris, while I was working on Yeezus and I had a meeting with him and it was related to doing a deal with Puma. And the guy, actually I forgot about the meeting right, so I had my jacket on and it was a jacket I had done with A.P.C. and I was about to leave, so he shows up at the door and we go to my dining room table and I'm sitting with him, and I tell him like yo I made this jacket. And he makes some joke about, you know “You did look pretty hot. I'm happy to know that you put on all those clothes for me.” 
Zane Lowe: Was he joking do you think? 
Kanye West: He was leveling. He was leveling the conversation, this is what people do all the time. Like if I meet someone who I respect or I look up to, I will literally like kiss their feet. You know someone that I know that's put in a lot of work. And it's a lot of agents, a lot of people who work under the main guy that will level, that will try to level you. You know when they talk to you, they talk down to you. And I'm just sitting like “Whoa, ok.” Obviously I have to show him like hey I'm working on this stuff and it's coming out good and this is all I have a chance to work on. You know like when I worked with A.P.C. I only had two times to look at the collection, you know I couldn't really grab it and dig into it the way I dig into like working on “All Of The Lights” or something like that, it's like, there's a timeline, a cut-off switch, especially when you're dealing with apparel and the way that people make apparel currently 
Zane Lowe: I can imagine the frustration for you at that moment in time as you're leading up to what has effectively occurred in the last year. Seeing something like you say, close to the vision you have in your mind. At those early stages, man the frustration of trying to get those ideas out and just like you said, and getting just levelled 
Kanye West: Everyone, everyone I talked to would try to level me. You know. And then there was this guy named Hermann Deininger that was the head of Adidas. And I say “was” because he passed away recently. And I showed him what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was using 7 screens, the surround vision idea which we've never shown online because you have to experience it in it's space. It's the same thing I showed Disney and Universal, and said you know this is the new frontier on the way we need to see film. And which I got all no's on that – to date. And this guy Hermann saw it, and he believed. He believed that maybe I had something more than how big my rap record was. In me he could tell, he knew, he's like this guy has something to say and to give that's past the current box that he's put in. And he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas deal got done. And the deal has nothing to do with the idea of the higher ups in society. The deal is all about the moment when I can bring a shoe to a kid a Foot Locker and get on my knees and take it back to when I worked at The Gap and put the shoes on his feet. That is what the deal is about. The deal is about when the star of a show is a 5 foot 3 girl, when there's never been a 5 foot 3 girl as the star of any fashion show. The deal is when the kids came to 42 locations across the world to see Yeezy Season 1 x Adidas Originals launch and the excitement that was in that theater, and when they saw that line up, they saw that brigade, they reacted to it when they heard “Wolves,"" when they saw the boots, when they saw the runners, when they saw the matrix sweaters, when they saw all these things like hitting them back to back to back to back. This is what I fought for. None of this was about me having like a bigger house, a faster Lamborghini. It, like, it wasn't about that. It was about these kids having a moment. To be themselves. To be a stronger version, you know, of themselves. I make this stuff to empower people. I feel like there's so many things that are made to, you know, to wear the people as opposed to people wearing it. And I asked my assistant one time. I was like, ""how does these clothes make you feel?"" She said, ""I feel powerful."" And that's our, that's our main goal. As the song says, ""no one man should have all that power."" No one man should have it. Everyone should have it 
Zane Lowe: You seem to be totally, well, a lot more aware of what it is that.. well, in a much, sort of like a more focused way you're able to know where you wanna be and what impact you wanna have. And it feels like you're very attached to the well-being of the people and what they can get out of this. You know, and across the border. And when that moment kind of occurred to you. Cause that doesn't happen overnight, you know.. there's.. but it does lead up to that. And 18 months ago you were fighting, you know, you were like really fighting to be heard. And now it seems to me like you're very consciously aware 
Kanye West: Yeah, I was still off, you know what I mean? I might have some things that are off now, but I feel like, in the same way when I came up with ""All Falls Down,"" and I was able to differentiate myself from whoever I was trying to rap like at that point and I found my voice and my message. It's like, I felt like.. 
Zane Lowe: That was the moment you felt like that was, yeah.. 
Kanye West: When I wrote ""All Falls Down."" That's when I was like, ""okay, this is who I am in the.. this is what I'm, this is what I'm presenting."" So now I feel like.. it's funny, I would always say, you know, ""I wanna sculpt with marble."" And it wasn't until I was working on Yeezus, and I was learning about furniture and the fact that I am a rich person that afforded me the opportunity to go to French flea markets and the galleries and buy, you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot for. And one of the things they had was this Le Corbusier lamp, and it was made of cement, and it was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because he made it for Zeus, so he made it for everyone. And it was made of cement. So it wasn't the material, it was the idea that was the most important. And I always wanted the resources of LVMH, but it wasn't until I started taking the sensibility of proportion and color and finishing and applying it to fleece and jersey French terry which is a cement in comparison to, you know, the type of materials that Louis Vuitton might use. That I find a message, a voice, a reason, a reason to create. You know, it was a futile argument for me to say, ""hey, everyone, get behind me so I can make another $5000 jacket that you can afford."" It's like insane. But now I feel people rallying because they know that I wanna fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I know that Adidas can eventually get those price points. And I want to apologize to everyone right now because I believe that Season 1 may still be in that upper price point and there's still the words ""exclusivity,"" you know, being thrown around. ""Exclusivity"" is the new N-word. Not nigga, ""exclusivity."" Am I saying the word right? 
skrrt skrrt
Kanye West: Yeah, that is the new N-word. Cause nothing should be exclusive. Everyone should have the opportunity to drink from the same fountain. The idea of exclusivity is a new colored-people fountain concept. And saying, ""we're gonna overcharge sneaker culture guys to, you know, drink at the right fountain."" You know, we have to reboot our mentality. Period. Of a generation. You know, it wouldn't even matter if I sold one sweatshirt. You know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids hear this and know this and or someone in position of power or someone that will be in a position of power in the future has a chance to make a difference. And they say someone who was at the lowest point grabbing at straws, express themselves freely, and overcame it through all adversary, all adversity, means that they can do the same thing. You know 
Zane Lowe: Yeah. Because the thing is when people hear you talking at times I think that there's a genuine consensus from those cause believe me, you're compelling to a lot of people. And, you know, what you say is.. I think you have very unique views on things that should be heard. But some people I think have thought overtime that.. they've obviously missed the point. They've thought that you bringing it back to you. But you're actually trying to open up to everybody else. You're trying to break down that barrier of exclusivity and say you know.. If you have to lead the way you have to lead the way. It might not end with you, but maybe if it starts with you is your point 
Kanye West: And I was, I was using the wrong words. My rap was wrong. You know what I'm saying? I was getting the drinks, you know, thrown in my face as opposed to leaving with the girl at the end of the night. You know, cause imagine, think about the type of shit, wild shit you say in interviews. And imagine if someone said this very thing to a girl at a bar. ""Yo, what up, baby? I'm a genius!"" They be like, ""yo, who's this guy?"" ""No, I'm telling you, I sold all this, I sold this many shoes."" Then she be like, ""yo, chill, chill."" Like, ""gosh, get me out of here already."" You know what I'm saying? And that's who I was and that was that frustration I had cause I'm seeing like this.. I'm looking at this girl like, ""man, I know that.."" 
Zane Lowe: ""We could be good together, this could work."" 
Kanye West: Yeah, I know, I just don't know how to work it 
Zane Lowe: So I'm messing it up, yeah 
Kanye West: And the right way so I'm gonna stumble. I was like the 40 year old virgin of dealing with like corporations and stuff you know.. 
Zane Lowe: You're the 40 year old virgin of dealing with corporations? 
Kanye West: Yeah. I did not know how to communicate at all. And it's like I had my point, my message was, you know, simply like, ""your egg, my semen, we change the world."" You know, and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong 
Zane Lowe: That's a hell of a pick up line, man 
Kanye West: I mean, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, because wrong is okay, you know like.. 
Zane Lowe: It's okay, it's okay, wrong.. 
Kanye West: We have the right to be wrong sometimes 
Zane Lowe: That's a great line. You know I wanted to talk to you.. when we started talking, you know, a while back, music was on my agenda because, you know, I mean, we talked a couple times before as well. And you know I'm a music guy, I mean, it really drives me, and it's a big part of my life. And over the course of this conversation, you know, I wanna ask you at some point what the future looks like and feels like to you cause I'm fascinated in the certain things I wanna touch on, but I do want to talk about your forthcoming, new record if that's cool. Do you want to talk about music? 
Kanye West: Yeah 
Zane Lowe: Cause to me it feels like over the course of that frustration last time you had to make sacrifices to be heard and it felt like you didn't really wanna talk about Yezus. You were like, ""that's cool and everything, but I wanna talk about this."" And lately, I just, maybe I'm, I feel like you're really energized with music in a big way 
Kanye West: You know, after I did the presentation in New York I was able to get that alien out of my stomach, you know like. I was on a flight back in the morning to go shoot the ""Blessings"" video with Big Sean and Drake 
skrrt skrrt
Kanye West: And I couldn't have been happier. To go and shoot this video with two of the hottest rappers in the game. Well, let's be respectful and truthful. The hottest rapper and one of the hottest rappers in the game. And I fall somewhere in that, you know? In that, that field. So.. 
Zane Lowe: Getting back to music for a minute, I feel like we're right back, I gotta bring you right back for a second. I want to know what we can look forward to on this record. You talked about cookout music, you talked about what this album represents. And every record you have made has been something new and fresh. You've taken yourself and your craft to a new place. Where's your head at right now with this new album? 
Kanye West: Just working hard. On it 
Zane Lowe: And it's fun? 
Kanye West: And it's fun. And it's fun to work hard and we're being inventive and I've still got some, you know, a lot of opinions and perspectives that I think are important and very.. can be inspiring to people. That fight, and you know, The College Dropout came out of a fight to want to rap. And this new album is coming out of a fight of wanting to design. And.. 
Zane Lowe: I wondered about that, cause Yeezus was punk-rock to me. That was like, that was Sex Pistols to me. That was like Public Enemy to me. That was one of the records that stands as establishing an industrial, strong statement. And I wondered like where the desire is coming from on this record. And without giving away too much cause the proof is in the hearing, the joy is in the hearing. Where it's coming from 
Kanye West: I mean, it's a joyful noise onto the Lord. Like, it is still, you know, the struggle, you know, but the beauty from the struggle. You know
Zane Lowe: As opposed to just the struggle?
Kanye West: Yea, the song Amazing Grace, you know coming out of the worst pain possible and making the most beautiful song you know, possible. You know I wanna perform “Only One” as many times as possible. You know could be vilified or misunderstood, and like I said I didn't come here to be liked I came here to make a difference. I'm not talking about this interview, I'm talking about life. Some people's job they're very extremely likeable and I think I could figure that out. I think I'm way nicer to people just in general. Everyone I meet I'm extremely nice. But as soon as people start playing games I stop. I stop playing games. And at any moment I can hit that Ye button and we can go right back to day one. People be forgetting though, they be forgetting real quick. But it's all love, and great energy and positive energy. I like the, I like the differences of views and our approach to music like when I'm sitting making music with Paul McCartney and I come in I have all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this happened and that happened and he say “Yo man, it's all cool though! How bout we make a song?” And we just make song, after song after song after song after song after song 
Zane Lowe: He is the most, cause I've met him many times now and he is just so tapped into the joy of making music. And he so gets it in the sense that it's like kinda let it lead you. Let the song sorta lead you to where it needs to go is the vibe I get from him like yea, let's just see where this goes 
Kanye West: And yea that's what we did. You know people think that our first two singles don't have drums but both of those are percussive instruments 
Zane Lowe: Yea totally that's what he's doing. That's like “dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun” that's what it is. S I just wanna talk about working with him because I haven't actually seen too many people focus on that which surprises me, maybe I'm wrong, but I just, I love the idea of that collaboration occurring and it's a natural one. Certainly on “FourFiveSeconds” I think that's one of Rihanna's greatest vocal performances period 
Kanye West: She was killing that right? 
Zane Lowe: My gosh man. I mean that's like a whole other attitude that I haven't heard from her as a star. She's really gone inside that record and wrangled it. How was it making that and getting that song out cause it feels effortless to listen to, it almost has like a 70's FM American rock, sort of country-rock radio vibe to it, you know what I mean, like something you would've heard in Los Angeles in '76 or something 
Kanye West: I mean I liked, I liked songs like that when I was growing up. And I mean the type of chord changes that Paul does, I don't need to understand them, and to be able to be involved with that.. 
Zane Lowe: It's because he invented them 
Kanye West: Yea exactly. And be able to be involved with writing a song like that, it's just like way next to, like meeting Paul McCartney is like meeting Ralph Lauren 
Zane Lowe: Yea, totally! 
Kanye West: It's like “whoa!” 
Zane Lowe: Dude he's the greatest 
Kanye West: The greatest of their field, period. Of all time 
Zane Lowe: And you got to say “wildin'” in a song with him it's just incredible cause it's still hip hop, that's what's amazing about it 
Kanye West: Yea the whole cadence was trap. Soon as Paul starts playing, I start singing in trap 
Zane Lowe: That's again is the fusion of cultures which I love. It's what did you call it before when you when you were talking about Sean wearing [Raf?] and your shoes – you were saying, it's -- I can't remember what you said 
Kanye West: Fusion is the future. Period. The mixing of ideas, the mixing of, know the two lunch tables working together, you know. Humanity period man, we're one people and maybe that's like incorrect English – I'm sorry mom – but you know I went to Louise Wilson's memorial, you know the greatest fashion instructor of all time. And I'm talking about of all timers. 
Zane Lowe: Educate us man, tell us 
Kanye West: Ok so Louise Wilson was the baddest professor of all time of any fashion school, ever. Notorious for not letting people stop at a 7 or a 8, pushing people to a 12. So the first time that I saw one of her students Pheobe Philo's Céline collection, I was looking at a 12. When I saw McQueen's last show the Atlantis collection, I was looking at a 12. Christopher Kane's Bandage collection I'm looking at a 12. Alber Elbaz I'm looking at a 12. That's the designer, the designer of Lanvin which completely revolutionized the men's sneaker, fashion sneaker industry. Last time I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is my favourite restaurant in London and I think she knew that she was gonna pass and she just wanted to give me some words of advice moving forward and she was asking me about my daughter, asking me about my wife. And she said so many students, they don't give it their all. And the problem is soon as they do anything halfway good, when they're 2 years old, 3 years old, their parents clap 
Zane Lowe: (clapping) 
Kanye West: Exactly, that's what she said, they clap. And she just looked at me, she said “Kanye, don't clap.” 
Well seeing that, I think I, maybe for one of the first times in my life, I understand how it is to feel humbled. I want to say some thank you's really quick. Thank God for Stephen Hill, who is so sincerely good at exactly what he does and gives so much and doesn't care about what Ghost somebody's driving or how big somebody's house is and brings the most awesome collection of classic, current, and futuristic black music every day. So make some noise for Stephen Hill to start this
So, since this is pre-taped and the fact that Adam Blackstone used to be my music director, I'm pretty sure he's not gonna start the music on me. If I go Chicago for a second, you know it was interesting when I went and visited Minister Louis Farrakhan, and I just really wanted to expand so much more on the things that I had been talking about over the past couple years. And it was interesting or groundbreaking and really special for me to see his reaction and his expression about my relationship with a woman not of color, and for us to focus on the idea of love and not the idea of separation. You know, at the barbershop and everything, I used to hear people talking about, ""You know when an entertainer get on, of course you know he gon' go and get a white girl and buy her all this... and the white girl gon' go and get a rich black dude."" But I want to say that my wife has dated broke black dudes. So it ain't got nothing to do with the money
Once upon a system of measurement
Where previous and upcoming ever take precedence
Over the infinitesimal instant that's really relevant
Called present tense
Yeezy for president
Look, look, run that back one more system of measurement Give it 60 seconds of resonance
Malevolent trying to be nevolent
Sneaking Spanish Fly to your gelatin like a pelican
Jello shots fired
I'm putting proof in the fire to test the golden inside it
Now is it true?
Or is what that accuse you to do really alleged?
Did your testimony end up irrelevant?
Them roses smelled like boo boo
You threw them petals to fans
Hit 'em in the face
Some continued waving their hands
I hit 'em with a tape of them glued-together pray hands
I choose the black and blue, emo, praying 4 you again
It hit the fan
Bush don't care about blacks was lacking eloquence

I remember when i got my 2nd car in 2005. It was an '02 Honda Accord SE. Leather seats, 4 doors, but it had a wack stereo with a cassette deck. I was having none of this shit, so as soon as I got a $1000 christmas bonus at the newspaper i was working at, i went straight to the speaker shop. I blew my entire bonus on a PHAT speaker system and getting my windows tinted. I remember rolling out of the shop and the first CD i had in the booklet was Kanye's Late Registration (a burned copy of course). I popped it in, ""Heard 'Em Say"" started bumpin' and i was ROLLIN HARD! This beat was so money...Kanye had been a great producer from the get-go, but he was coming into his own as a rapper. Fast forward to 2013 and he's basically the biggest rapper on the planet. Forget the chill vibes of ""Heard 'Em Say""...Adam Levine? Ha...hell no. Kanye's got wayy too much to get off his chest on Yeezus to fuck with Maroon 5. This is a guy on top of the world...literally. And looking at the world through his eyes is nothing short of fascinating
Yeezus is wayyyy more than rap. We see this the minute the album opens, on ""On Sight"" and Yeezy ain't fuckin around. He's got Daft Punk AND Benji B producing the track with him? The result is some HEAVY synth that's nothing short of cosmic. Think of the club in that new Tron movie where Daft Punk was playing. If you were at some club in the matrix or in outer space somewhere, this is the beat you'd be hearing. 'Ye intersperses a sick soul sample and just goes off on a tirade, highlighted by gems like: How much do I not give a fuck?
Let me show you right now 'fore you give it up Ok..I see where this is going. Right into another Daft Punk collabo on ""Black Skinhead."" A track filled with HUGE drum hits that he dropped a dark and often times terrifying interactive video for. This is not just some regular-ass album release. This is next-level shit. We see him just not giving a fuck by dropping perhaps the most disputed lyric of the year: I keep it 300, like the Romans 
300 bitches, where the Trojans? Can't tell you how many fan boys and girls were FURIOUS at this one. ""It wasn't the Romans in that movie! It was the Spartans!"" But man, Kanye delivers it with such emphasis. He doesn't stutter for a second and he's so wrapped up in the beat. It's like the brilliant thespian who skips a line and you don't even notice, you're just enamored with the performance. He got everyone talking with this slip-up, or was it?
Everything seemed so calculated with this album and it was genius stroke after genius stroke. The first taste we got of the record was the global premier of the ""New Slaves"" video. A cryptic map on his website showed the locations of this video projection in major cities around the world. I was in San Francisco at the time and trekked down to 2nd & Mission at 11pm with a buddy and a flask. This was some guerilla shit for sure. These surly dudes showed up with a full-size pickup truck and what looked like a 200 pound projector. The surly dudes pulled up the projector with all their weight to position it and they beamed Kanye up on a high rise in the financial district that was maybe 300 yards away. This was surreal. The video played three times in a row while the music blared on a single massive speaker. By the 3rd time, we were rappin' along. Sharing booze, dancing in the street. It was so dope. As it ended, i yelled out a scream ""let's go to the next one!"" and we trekked over to Union Square for the 1145 showing. THIS is what being a star is about these days. How you gonna top what the last guy did?! And there was nothing that felt contrived about it. You could feel Kanye's emotion on the Big Brother-like projection of his head against a building
Let me tell y'all something. There will never be a Watch the Throne 2. You know why? Because that's the reason why I wasn't on the song [""Pop Style""]. I wasn't on the song because of Hov. Because of some Tidal/Apple bullshit. This shit get me tight every time I perform this motherfucker. Y'all didn't get what y'all was supposed to get with me and Drake on this song because of some Tidal/Apple bullshit. This shit got me tight. Every time I perform this song I think about the shit. I think about the politics and the bullshit. I think about how hard I go for music, for art, for y'all, for the fans—how hard we go
[On tour merchandise featuring the Confederate flag imagery]
React how you want. Any energy you got is good energy. You know, the Confederate flag represented slavery. That's my abstract take on what I know about it.
So I made the song “New Slaves.” So I took the Confederate flag and made it my flag. It's my flag now, now whatchu gonna do?
It looks cool. I like at maybe 800 images a day. You know, I've been working on clothing seriously for the past 11 years.
It's colorless also. It's super, like, hood and super white-boy-approved at the same time. And that's really what my style's always been, because I lived in the suburbs, where, you know, I was known as the Black kid, and I lived in the hood where I was known as the kid who spent his summers in the suburbs.
My dad was a military brat, and he would be around white people back then when it was like, racism was really popular and people would be racist against him, and he'd get around Black people and they'd kinda discriminate against him because they'd say he acted ‘white' or talked ‘white.' So there are times when I'll talk and you'll hear some of that white--or what people call ‘white'--the suburb voice come through and it's times you'll hear some of that Chicago come through. I'm influenced by all those things.

Didn't use to have to
Primetime, yeah this is my time to shine
This is the time that's mine
But you pricks took it away & now it's gone, but not for long
I told you. But if I would have voted, I would have voted on Trump. [audience boos]
Now, there's people that I love that did vote that voted for Hillary and I don't love them no less because they had their opinion. I love friends that I have that voted on Hillary. My manager, Scooter Braun, voted on Hillary. One of my management team. My other manager, Izzy, I'm gonna assume voted on Hillary. Everybody said that if you voted on Trump you have to go back to like Montauk or shit. And guess what? That entire team still put together this show tonight with people with differences of opinion, still put this show together tonight and still came together and made this show for y'all. They told me, “Ye, do not say that out loud. Whatever you do, do not say that out loud.” And I just said it! I wanted to say that before the election and they told me, “Do not say that out loud. Whatever you do, do not say that.” That don't mean that I don't think that Black Lives Matter. That don't mean I don't think that I'm a believer in women's rights. That don't mean I don't believe in gay marriage. That don't mean that I don't believe in these things because that was the guy I would have voted for.
Run the next song.
Believe that there are people here enjoying, or before I start talking at least, enjoying a Kanye West show. By a show of screams do you believe that there are people at a Kanye West show who voted for Trump? [audience screams] Oh, it sound differently from before, huh? It sounds different. Why did we boo the first time on something that wasn't, “Hey, do you like Trump?” That wasn't what I asked. I asked you to give me your facts because the internet was giving you their facts based on what you wanted to hear and a lot of you guys got blindsided.
How that make you think, though? The fact that I just asked that undeniable question? That in most music situations you have the Democrats always since the beginning of time. The Democrats were considered to be more liberal. The Democrats were supposed to be more futuristic in their approach. The Democrats were supposed to have more empathy and be more about the people and that relates directly to music and it also relates to celebrity and the idea of what music does for you. Democrat is like music to your ears or something. Bye. Your voices. Do you believe–what percentage of people here–and by the way, I'm not setting y'all up, I'm not setting y'all up I've got no time for bullshit–what I'm saying is, what percentage of people here do you think voted for Trump? Do you think it was two people here? Do you think maybe it was 100 people? Do you think maybe it was 1,000 people out of the 15,000 people here? No, I'm asking you, what do you really believe? One person. Two people. What do you really believe? What do you really believe? What do you really believe? What do you really believe? What do you really believe? What do you really believe?
I haven't talked about anybody's stances on anything. I haven't talked about any quote that anybody gave from either side. That's not what I'm talking 'bout. That's not what I'm asking you. What I'm asking you is what you really believe. I put something that I would bet on. I bet that it might be 20 percent or maybe even 30 percent of this very audience right here that might have voted for Trump. I bet you 15 percent, 50 percent of them, would never say that at a Kanye West show because of the climate right now. And they don't know they might think I'm like, “Oh, they voted for Trump... y'all should go ahead and….” It's the opposite of that. People got the right to vote for whoever they want to vote for. That's the right to vote! That is our right! I did not vote. Aww, no. The Saint Pablo ticket sales are going down now. Aww no, t-shirts. “Aww nah, you just got out of jail Ye. You had to deal with the Taylor Swift shit for seven years now you gonna go say some... naw, Ye don't say shit. Just step out.” Fuck that, bro. That's the reality.

Look for me! Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside Highway
Doing what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today, I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashing the gas, she's grabbing the wheel
It's trippy how hard she rides with me
The new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
‘Cause mami's a rider, and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keeping me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
